    "title": "G proteins as drug targets.",
    "abstract": "The structure and function of heterotrimeric G protein subunits is known in considerable detail. Upon stimulation of a heptahelical receptor by the appropriate agonists, the cognate G proteins undergo a cycle of activation and deactivation; the alpha-subunits and the beta gamma-dimers interact sequentially with several reaction partners (receptor, guanine nucleotides and effectors as well as regulatory proteins) by exposing appropriate binding sites. For most of these domains, low molecular weight ligands have been identified that either activate or inhibit signal transduction. These ligands include short peptides derived from receptors, G protein subunits and effectors, mastoparan and related insect venoms, modified guanine nucleotides, suramin analogues and amphiphilic cations. Because compounds that act on G proteins may be endowed with new forms of selectivity, we propose that G protein subunits may therefore be considered as potential drug targets.",

More recently, the two therapies have been used together in an attempt to exploit their mutual interactions against cancer. The goal of this review is to explore the literature related to combined hyperthermia and liposomal drug delivery for cancer therapy. The motivation behind combining hyperthermia and liposomal drug delivery is discussed from a physical chemical and physiological standpoint. Two types of therapeutic ratios were calculated for in vivo studies from across the literature. These ratios compared the results obtained from hyperthermia and liposomes to hyperthermia and free drug as well as to liposomes without hyperthermia. These two therapeutic ratios were applied to both tumour drug uptake and tumour growth delay studies. In all studies reviewed, hyperthermia in combination with liposomal drug showed an enhanced therapeutic effect compared to either treatment modality alone or hyperthermia and free drug. Future work needs to be focused on optimizing thermosensitive liposomes and understanding the effect of thermal dose on liposomal drug delivery. Though not currently used in the clinic, this combination therapy seems to hold great promise towards improving current cancer therapeutic regimens.",

    "abstract": "The malaria parasite life cycle presents several targets for attack, but these different parts of the life cycle are susceptible to different types of host immune response. For example, the sporozoite is most sensitive to immune antibody, while liver stage parasites can be eliminated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Attachment of merozoites to erythrocytes, on the other hand, can be blocked by antibody. Convincing experimental evidence shows that completely protective immunity to malaria can be induced. The challenge now is to design recombinant or synthetic vaccines that induce the right types of immune responses to specific life cycle stages. This requires the identification and characterization of B- and T-lymphocyte epitopes expressed by the parasite or by parasitized host cells. These epitopes must be incorporated into a delivery system that maximizes the interaction between the vaccine epitopes and the host immune system. Many epitopes from several parts of the life cycle are already characterized; development of multivalent vaccines, that is, vaccines which contain immunogens from more than one part of the life cycle, is a promising area for research efforts.",

However, other small molecules lacking these particular molecular properties, antisense drugs, and peptide-based pharmaceuticals generally undergo negligible transport through the blood-brain barrier in pharmacologically significant amounts. Therefore, if present day CNS drug discovery programs are to avoid termination caused by negligible blood-brain barrier transport, it is important to merge CNS drug discovery and CNS drug delivery as early as possible in the overall CNS drug development process. Strategies for special formulation that enable drug transport through the blood-brain barrier arise from knowledge of the molecular and cellular biology of blood-brain barrier transport processes.",

I) Genetic engineering is used to produce humanized monoclonal antibodies that target endogenous BBB transporters and act as vectors for delivery of drugs or genes to the human brain. The conjugate of a neurotherapeutic and a BBB transport vector is called a chimeric peptide. Epidermal growth factor chimeric peptides have been used for neuroimaging of brain cancer. Brain-derived neutrophic factor chimeric peptides have marked neuroprotective effects in brain stroke models. II) Imaging gene expression in the brain in vivo is possible with sequence-specific antisense radiopharmaceuticals, which are conjugated to BBB drug targeting vectors. III) Brain gene targeting technology enables widespread expression of an exogenous gene throughout the central nervous system following an intravenous injection of a non-viral therapeutic gene. IV) A BBB genomics program enables the future discovery of novel transport systems expressed at the BBB. These transporters may be carrier-mediated transport systems, active efflux transporters, or receptor-mediated transcytosis systems. The future discovery of novel BBB transport systems and the application of brain drug targeting technology will enable the delivery to the brain of virtually any neurotherapeutic, including small molecules, large molecules and gene medicines.",

Pegylated liposomal doxorubucin has shown substantial efficacy in breast cancer treatment both as monotherapy and in combination with other chemotherapeutics.

Despite surgical treatment and irradiation, chemotherapy remains one of the important means to treat cancer. Although many institutions and companies have tried to establish new treatment strategies such as immunotherapy or vaccination, the conventional chemotherapy still remains an important treatment option. In this review, we present an overview of new and innovative treatment strategies for cancer chemotherapy.

Possibly because of the combination of both effects these particles were able to significantly improve the bioavailability of some drugs after peroral administration in comparison with solutions.

    "title": "The blood-brain and blood-tumor barriers: a review of strategies for increasing drug delivery.",
    "abstract": "Drug delivery to brain tumors has been a controversial subject. Some believe the blood-brain barrier is not important, while others believe it is the major obstacle in treatment and have devised innovative approaches to circumvent it. These approaches can be divided into two categories: those that attempt to increase drug delivery of intravascularly administered drugs by manipulating either the drugs or capillary permeability, and those that attempt to increase drug delivery by local administration. Several strategies have been developed to increase the fraction of intravascular drug reaching the tumor, including intra-arterial administration, barrier disruption, new ways of packaging drugs, and, most recently, inhibiting drug efflux from tumor. When given intravascularly, all drugs have a common drawback: the body acts as a sink, and, even in the best situations, only a small fraction of administered drug actually reaches the tumor. A consequence is that systemic toxicity is usually the dose-limiting factor. When given locally, such as into the cerebrospinal fluid or directly into the tumor, 100% of an administered dose is delivered to the target site. However, local delivery is associated with variable and unpredictable spatial distribution and variation in drug concentration. The major dose-limiting factor of most local delivery methods will be neurotoxicity. The relative advantages and disadvantages of the different methods of circumventing the blood-brain barrier are presented in this review, and special attention is given to convection-enhanced delivery, which has particular promise for the local delivery of large therapeutic agents such as monoclonal antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, or viral vectors.",

A handful of needle-free immunization technologies have emerged in recent years that aim to take advantage of these characteristics. Skin delivery technologies provide potentially safer alternatives to needle injection and promises increased efficacy in the prevention and/or therapy of infectious diseases, allergic disorders and cancer. In this review, we will cover advances in needle-free skin vaccination technologies and their potential applications to disease prevention and therapy.

Among the various carbohydrate ligands, such as glycoproteins, glycolipids, viral proteins, polysaccharides, lipo-polysaccharides and other oligosaccharides, this review deals with the polysaccharide anchored liposomal system for their potential in drug delivery, targeting and immunization. Over the years, various strategies have been developed which include coating of the liposomal surface with natural or hydrophobized polysaccharides, namely mannan, pullulan, amylopectin, dextran etc., or their palmitoyl or cholesteroyl derivatives. The polysaccharide(s) coat tends vesicular constructs physicochemically stable in bio-environments and site-specific. The aim of improving the physical and biochemical stability of liposomes and the ability to target liposomes to specific organs and cells, were the major attributes of the polysaccharide anchored liposomes. In this review the authors attempted to overview various applications of polysaccharide bearing liposomes, including lung therapeutics, targeted chemotherapy, cellular targeting, cellular or mucosal immunity and macrophage activation. Future prospects of the delivery module are also discussed. The review in general explores the concepts, options and opportunities of polysaccharide anchored liposomes with newer perspectives.",

Initial work focused on the structural and physico-chemical requirements favouring transport across the BBB as related to anatomical and physiological features. Such studies have had a significant effect on the design of CNS-active drugs with improved permeability across the BBB. Progress in pharmacology and neurosciences resulted in greater knowledge of CNS diseases and of potential therapies, but also created the need to develop new strategies to improve drug delivery to the brain. For a long time the BBB was considered to be a physical barrier, mainly represented by the cerebrovascular endothelium; however, transport of drugs to the brain may be limited by the metabolic activity of the BBB. The BBB should be regarded as a dynamic rather than a rigid barrier; it can be influenced by astrocytes and probably also by neuronal and hormonal stimuli, and its properties are also affected by diseases of the CNS. This may offer new strategies for targeting drugs to the brain.",

However, effective polymer-based gene therapy requires the control of cellular access and uptake, intracellular trafficking, and nuclear retention of plasmid DNA. Inefficient endosomal release, cytoplasmic transport, and nuclear entry of plasmids are currently limiting factors in the use of polymers for effective plasmid-based gene therapy. Therefore, several different polymeric gene carriers have been designed recently in an attempt to overcome these problems. This review explores the conceptual and experimental aspects of polymer-based gene delivery and presents an overview on the recent use of polymers to enhance the effectiveness of plasmid-based systems.

    "abstract": "During the past 2 decades, anesthesiologists have been provided with a number of new, potent opioid analgesics and sedative/hypnotics, as well as an increased understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles that govern their action and disposition. These developments have suggested that the skin and the buccal and nasal mucous membranes may have use as alternate routes of analgesic and anesthetic drug delivery. A novel transmucosal delivery system for fentanyl has recently been developed by incorporating the drug into a dissolvable matrix on a stick called an \"oralete.\" Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate has been evaluated as a premedication in the pediatric population and as an analgesicfor acute postoperative and emergency room pain, procedural pain, and breakthrough cancer pain by using fentanyl. Increases in plasma fentanyl and onset of clinical effect are rapid (20-40 min) with this formulation. A potential advantage is the apparent ease of titration to a sedative or analgesic end point. This system may improve premedication, acute postoperative analgesia, and chronic pain therapy in various clinical settings. Delivery of opioids through the nasal mucosa also has been recently investigated. In one study, sufentanil was administered (1.5, 3.0, or 4.5 mu/kg) to 80 children ranging in age from 6 mo to 7yr. Easy separation from parents was achieved in 86% of the children 10 min following administration of the premedication. Unfortunately, 61% of the children cried after drug administration, and side effects included reduced ventilatory compliance (chest-wall rigidity) with higher doses (3.0 and 4.5 microg/kg). Nevertheless, nasal transmucosal drug delivery may have value, especially in frightened or uncooperative children.",

Although the first generation of DNA plasmid vaccines were broadly effective in animal disease models, early clinical immunogenicity pointed towards the need for increased potency.

It is also known to play a role in membrane remodeling processes as well as in cellular signaling cascades. PLA2 is interfacially active and functions mainly on organized types of substrate, e.g. micelles and lipid bilayers. Hence the activity of the enzyme is modulated by the lateral organization and the physical properties of the substrate, in particular the structure in the nanometer range. The evidence for nano-scale structure and lipid domains in bilayers is briefly reviewed. Results obtained from a variety of experimental and theoretical studies of PLA2 activity on lipid-bilayer substrates are then presented which provide insight into the biophysical mechanisms of PLA2 activation on lipid bilayers and liposomes of different composition. The insight into these mechanisms has been used to propose a novel principle for liposomal drug targeting, release, and absorption triggered by secretory PLA2.",

By virtue of the sustained in vivo antigen synthesis and the comprised stimulatory CpG motifs, plasmid DNA vaccines appear to induce strong and long-lasting humoral (antibodies) and cell-mediated (T-help, other cytokine functions and cytotoxic T cells) immune responses without the risk of infection and without boost. Other advantages over traditional antigen-containing vaccines are their low cost, the relative ease with which they are manufactured, their heat stability, the possibility of obtaining multivalent vaccines and the rapid development of new vaccines in response to new strains of pathogens. The antigen-encoding DNA may be in different forms and formulations, and may be introduced into cells of the body by numerous methods. To date, animal models have shown the possibility of producing effective prophylactic DNA vaccines against numerous viruses as well as other infectious pathogens. The strong cellular responses also open up the possibility of effective therapeutic DNA vaccines to treat chronic viral infections.",

In addition, osmotic minipumps have been extensively used since 1978, resulting in over 6000 publications in the pharmacological, endocrinological and physiological literature. Rate-controlled delivery provides for drug entry into the bloodstream continuously at either a constant or a modulated rate. By this means, one avoids the usual peak and trough pattern of drug concentrations in plasma, with its echoing peak and trough pattern of drug actions, during the interval between successive doses. In contrast to the happenstance release kinetics of rapid-release dosage forms, rate-controlled delivery systems can be designed to provide specific temporal patterns of drug concentration in plasma, for the purpose of optimizing the selectivity of drug action, the interval between successive administerings of drug and the likelihood that the next administering will occur at the proper time.",

    "title": "Photochemical internalisation: a novel drug delivery system.",
    "abstract": "The present report reviews a number of recently published papers on a novel technology for the cytosolic delivery of macromolecules named photochemical internalisation (PCI). PCI is based upon the light activation of a drug (a photosensitizer) specifically located in the membrane of endocytic vesicles. Light which is absorbed by the photosensitizer induces the formation of reactive oxygen species, of which singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) is the predominant form. Singlet oxygen oxidizes biomolecules in the membranes of endosomes and lysosomes, resulting in a subsequent release of the contents of these compartments into the cytosol. Photosensitizers have a higher affinity for tumour tissues than for most normal tissues and are used in photodynamic therapy of various types of cancers. We have taken advantage of the PCI strategy to enhance the delivery of a variety of macromolecules, including ribosome-inactivating toxins, an immunotoxin, horse radish peroxidase, a ras peptide, RNA, oligonucleotides and protein encoding DNA, to the cytosol. Normally, a major intracellular barrier to the application of therapeutically interesting peptides and proteins or the application of DNA and RNA in gene therapy is the degradation of the macromolecules in the endocytic vesicles after uptake by endocytosis. Therefore, a photochemically induced rupture of endocytic vesicles and the subsequent cytosolic release of the macromolecules aids these molecules in escaping attack by the lysosomal hydrolases, thereby maintaining their biological activity. Thus, PCI represents a novel principle for the cytosolic delivery of biologically active macromolecules which overcomes the pivotal intracellular barrier of endosomes and lysosomes. In addition to being utilised as a new site-specific cancer therapy method, PCI can also be applied as a research tool for macromolecule delivery both in vitro and in vivo.Copyright 2002 S.

    "abstract": "Treatment options for patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) have changed very little over the past decade. Research has been hampered by the absence of an accepted staging system for KS and the lack of a uniform definition of response. New advances in understanding the pathogenesis of KS, particularly the role of angiogenesis and growth factors, may help in the future development of additional therapies. At present, available options include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and biologic response modifiers. Improved delivery systems for existing chemotherapeutic agents may help to target more effective doses to KS lesions and to prevent certain dose-limiting side effects. Our goal should be to recommit ourselves to finding ways to improve the survival of patients with AIDS-related KS, not j ust to deliver cosmetic or palliative treatments.",

    "title": "In vivo targeting by liposomes.",
    "abstract": "This review deals with the current status of newly developed pendant-type PEG-immunoliposomes (Type C), carrying monoclonal antibodies or their fragments (Fab') at the distal ends of the PEG chains. In terms of target binding of Type C, two different anatomical compartments are considered. They are mouse lung endothelium as a readily accessible site via the intravascular route and the implanted solid tumor as a much less accessible target site reached via extravasation. Distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine derivatives of PEG with a carboxyl group (DSPE-PEG-COOH) and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine derivatives of PEG with a maleimidyl group (DPPE-PEG-Mal) at the PEG terminus were newly synthesized. Small unilamellar liposomes (90-130 nm in diameter) were prepared from phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol (2 : 1, m/m) containing 6 mol% of DSPE-PEG-COOH or DPPE-PEG-Mal. For targeting to the vascular endothelial surface in the lung, 34A antibody, which is highly specific to mouse pulmonary endothelial cells, was conjugated to PEG-liposomes (34A-Type C). The degree of lung binding of 34A-Type C in BALB/c mouse was significantly higher than that of 34A-Type A, which is an ordinary type of immunoliposome (without PEG derivatives). For targeting to solid tumor tissue, 21B2 antibody (anti-human CEA) and its Fab' fragment were used. The targeting ability of Fab'-Type C was examined by using CEA-positive human gastric cancer strain MKN-45 cells inoculated into BALB/c nu/nu mice. Fab'-Type C showed low RES uptake and a long circulation time, and enhanced accumulation of the liposomes in the solid tumor was seen. The small Fab'-Type C predominantly passed through the leaky tumor endothelium by passive convective transport. These studies offer important insights into the potential of Type C liposomes for target-specific drug delivery.",

Br J Gen Pract. 1996 Dec;46(413):757.Successful management of asthmatic patients depends on achieving adequate delivery of inhaled drugs to the lung. This assumes particular importance for inhaled corticosteroids where the therapeutic goal should be to achieve a high ratio of airway anti-inflammatory efficacy to local and systemic side effects. The availability of user-friendly inhaler devices requires a critical appraisal of their effectiveness and an evaluation of whether improved lung deposition of anti-asthma drugs translates into improved clinical efficacy. There is evidence to suggest that the routine use of large-volume spacers for inhaled corticosteroids may not be the best first-line option, in that reduced drug delivery is associated with multiple actuations, inhalation delay and the presence of static electricity. Breath-actuated pressurized aerosol devices or dry powder inhaler devices may be a better option for many asthmatic patients, although the efficiency of drug delivery varies considerably between these devices. There is good evidence with a reservoir dry powder inhaler device to show that improved lung deposition translates into better therapeutic response, both in terms of beta 2-agonist and corticosteroid delivery. For inhaled corticosteroids, such as fluticasone propionate and budesonide, there is evidence to show that systemic bioactivity is mainly determined by lung bioavailability rather than gastrointestinal bioavailability, because of the absence of first-pass metabolism of these drugs in the lung. There is also evidence to show that the greater glucocorticoid potency of fluticasone propionate translates directly into greater systemic bioactivity, but not into enhanced efficacy, at doses above 1 mg daily. The use of efficient delivery systems, such as the reservoir dry powder inhaler device, may not only improve control of asthma and compliance with therapy, but may also allow dose reduction ('step-down' therapy) and hence may possibly reduce overall prescribing costs in the long term.",

    "title": "Calcium antagonists in cardiology: update on sustained-release drug delivery systems.",
    "abstract": "One limitation of standard oral formulations of calcium antagonists has been the need for multiple daily dosing. Sustained-release dosage forms permit simpler regimens and a smoother therapeutic effect. Differences in drug pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties have led to development of several sustained-release delivery systems. Three major types are available: the osmotic pump, coated pellet, and slow-dissolving material released from a matrix. Each is currently utilized with specific calcium antagonists. The osmotic pump system with nifedipine (Procardia XL, Pfizer) allows once-daily dosing as well as improvements in certain side effects. Verapamil is available in formulations employing dissimilar release systems. The original sustained-action products (Calan SR, Searle; Isoptin SR, Knoll) utilize a matrix system; a subsequent product (Verelan; Lederle, Wyeth-Ayerst, A. H. Robins) utilizes timed-release pellets. Importantly, clinical efficacy appears to be maintained with these several drugs and formulations for their approved indications. Although a specific formulation may alter the absorption, metabolism, excretion, and blood levels of a drug, it does not alter basic drug properties. Thus, the major impact of sustained-release drug delivery system lies in potential compliance improvement and possible reduction of side effects related to serum drug profiles.",

    "abstract": "The removal of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellants from industrial and household products has been agreed to by over 165 countries of which more than 135 are developing countries. The timetable for this process is outlined in the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer document and in several subsequent amendments. Pressured metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) for medical use have been granted temporary exemptions until replacement formulations, providing the same medication via the same route, and with the same efficacy and safety profiles, are approved for human use. Hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs) are the alternative propellants for CFCs-12 and -114. Their potential for damage to the ozone layer is nonexistent, and while they are greenhouse gases, their global warming potential is a fraction (one-tenth) of that of CFCs. Replacement formulations for almost all inhalant respiratory medications have been or are being produced and tested; in Canada, it is anticipated that the transition to these HFA or CFC-free pMDIs will be complete by the year 2005. Initially, an HFA pMDI was to be equivalent to the CFC pMDI being replaced, in terms of aerosol properties and effective clinical dose. However, this will not necessarily be the situation, particularly for some corticosteroid products. Currently, only one CFC-free formulation is available in Canada - Airomir, a HFA salbutamol pMDI. This paper discusses the in vitro aerosol characteristics, in vivo deposition and clinical data for several HFA pMDIs for which there are data available in the literature. Alternative delivery systems to the pMDI, namely, dry powder inhalers and nebulizers, are briefly reviewed.",

    "title": "Novel forms of insulin delivery.",
    "abstract": "Despite its widespread use, much is wrong with conventional subcutaneous insulin injection. It is more-or-less painful and inconvenient; it delivers insulin slowly with highly inconsistent pharmacokinetics into the peripheral venous system rather than directly to the liver via the portal vein; and, once delivered into the skin, it cannot be \"turned off\". This review has focused on novel alternative approaches to insulin delivery. The clinically available insulin delivery devices, such as pen injectors and external insulin pumps, are probably underutilized. Pen injectors offer convenience, whereas external pumps offer a basal/bolus approach to insulin delivery unlike that achieved by injections. Of the approaches currently under development, IPPs are closet to general availability. They have been extremely popular in more than 600 patients worldwide, however, an insulin problem has delayed application for their PMA in the United States. Feasibility studies of inhaled insulin, nasal insulin, and oral insulin have produced interesting preliminary findings, with pulmonary delivery for meal coverage with short-acting insulin having perhaps the brightest prospects. Encapsulated islets and biohybrid systems that place live islets into an implanted device are in earlier stages of development. Closing the loop with a continuous glucose sensor will be the only way to achieve truly normal blood glucose homeostasis by directing insulin delivery automatically on demand. Glucose sensors would have many other clinical applications in diabetes management in addition to driving a mechanical delivery system. However, the development of glucose sensing devices has been a formidable technical challenge. Based on an evaluation of current technologic development, glucose oxidase-based, needle-type sensors may become available within the next few years. Clinicians, the research community, and persons with diabetes can join in rejecting the notion that standard regimens of insulin injection do not need to be improved. If there is adequate incentive to continue a broad-based research effort into novel approaches to insulin delivery, the quality of life of persons with diabetes can be improved in the not too distant future.",

This overview summarizes the relevant pharmacokinetic data for the contraceptive patch.DESIGN: Review article.RESULT(S): The amount of norelgestromin and EE absorbed from the patch is proportional to patch size: the 20-cm(2) patch (Ortho Evra) delivers norelgestromin, 150 microg/d, and EE, 20 microg/d, to the systemic circulation. After single and multiple applications of the contraceptive patch, daily serum concentrations (area under the serum concentration-versus-time curve) of norelgestromin and EE were within the ranges generally seen with oral norgestimate, 250 microg/EE 35 microg (Ortho-Cyclen/Cilest), but without the peaks and troughs characteristic of oral dosing. Moreover, the contraceptive patch maintains serum concentrations of norelgestromin and EE within these ranges for up to 10 days, suggesting that clinical efficacy would be maintained even if a scheduled change is missed for as long as two full days. Regardless of the location of patch application (abdomen, buttock, upper outer arm, or torso [excluding breasts]) and even under conditions of heat, humidity, exercise, and cool-water immersion, efficacious concentrations of norelgestromin and EE are achieved. Coadministration of the patch with tetracycline did not affect the pharmacokinetics of norelgestromin and EE.CONCLUSION(S): The contraceptive patch exhibits an excellent pharmacokinetic profile, maintaining efficacious serum hormone concentrations under varying conditions.",

Although new neuropharmaceuticals have the potential for treating specific brain diseases, they may not effectively enter brain from blood. Safe strategies are needed for drug delivery through the brain capillary wall, which makes up the blood-brain barrier in vivo. Two of these strategies are reviewed, as are related new developments in the molecular and cell biology of the brain capillary endothelium. The production of chimeric peptides represents a physiologic-based strategy for drug delivery. It entails the covalent coupling of the neuropharmaceutical to a brain transport vector, allowing transportation through the blood-brain barrier. Another strategy is biochemical opening of the blood-brain barrier: intracarotid leukotriene infusion is a method for selectively increasing blood-brain barrier permeability in brain tumors without affecting barrier permeability in normal brain tissue.",

In the development of target-based drugs, translational research is considered to be essential. In this review, the definition of translational research is clearly explained, and the points of misunderstanding of Japanese researchers are discussed and resolved. The primary goal of translational research is to integrate the advanced informations of molecular biology in moving forward from phase I and II trials to phase III trials of target-based drugs.",

    "abstract": "Broadly, the history of pharmaceutical biotechnology includes Alexander Fleming\"s discovery of penicillin in a common mold, in 1928, and the subsequent development-prompted by World War II injuries-of large-scale manufacturing methods to grow the organism in tanks of broth. Pharmaceutical biotechnology has since changed enormously. Two breakthroughs of the late 1970s became the basis of the modern biotech industry: the interspecies transplantation of genetic material, and the fusion of tumor cells and certain leukocytes. The cells resulting from such fusion-hybridomas-replicate endlessly and can be geared to produce specific antibodies in bulk. Modern pharmaceutical biotechnology encompasses gene cloning and recombinant DNA technology. Gene cloning comprises isolating a DNA-molecule segment that corresponds to a single gene and synthesizing (\"copying\") the segment. Recombinant DNA technology, or gene splicing, comprises altering genetic material outside an organism-for example, by inserting into a DNA molecule a segment from a very different DNA molecule-and making the altered material (recombinant DNA) function in living things. Recombinant DNA technology enables modifying microorganisms, animals, and plants so that they yield medically useful substances, particularly scarce human proteins (by giving animals human genes, for example). This review, however, focuses not on pharmaceutical biotechnology\"s methods but on its products, notably recombinant pharmaceuticals. It describes various types of biotech pharmaceuticals, their safety and effectiveness relative to the safety and effectiveness of conventionally produced pharmaceuticals, and the regulation of biotech pharmaceuticals.",

    "abstract": "Preexposure of rats to sublethal levels of hyperoxia or ozone reduces morbidity and mortality when the animals are subsequently exposed to lethal levels of either oxidant stress. Lung homogenates and isolated type II pneumocytes from rats exposed to these oxidant stresses demonstrate enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities. Antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase are responsible for the detoxification of partially reduced oxygen species, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, to less reactive states. Potential pulmonary cellular loci of partially reduced oxygen include mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase, endoplasmic reticulum-derived NADPH cytochrome c reductase, and cytosolic xanthine oxido reductase. Thus partially reduced oxygen species are hypothesized to mediate hyperoxia and ozone-induced pulmonary damage. This damage may be attenuated by enhanced intracellular antioxidant enzyme activities. Pharmacologic augmentation of pulmonary antioxidant enzymes may be accomplished via intratracheal or intravascular delivery of liposomes containing antioxidant enzymes. Rats pretreated with liposomes containing both superoxide dismutase and catalase, when subsequently exposed to lethal levels of hyperoxia, demonstrate enhanced survival compared with control animals or with animals treated with control liposomes or native antioxidant enzymes. Finally, knowledge obtained from in vitro investigations optimizing liposomal delivery to specific pulmonary cell types may further aid in reducing in vivo pulmonary damage to hyperoxia and ozone.",

A hallmark of mycobacteria is the complex lipid-rich cell envelope that protects the organism from both the host response and antimycobacterial therapy. In addition, mycobacteria are facultative intracellular parasites which generally cause a more chronic type of disease. These properties add greater constraints to efficient therapy. To be effective, drugs must be able to penetrate the host macrophage and preferably have reduced toxicity and be effective at low doses to allow prolonged therapy. The author presents the general properties of the pathogen/host relationship in mycobacterial infections, in addition to the therapeutic choices available and the mechanisms of action involved in treatment. The evolution of technology for antimycobacterial therapy is illustrated by a discussion of new strategies being developed for the treatment of mycobacterial infections.",

Many of the predictions generated in silico by genomics have been validated through functional analysis, including studies of the transcriptome and proteome, and led to the identification of essential genes. Knowledge of the latter defines potential targets for new and existing drugs and their specificity can be assessed by comparative genomics with the host or other pathogens.

Moreover, the stratum corneum is responsive to external perturbations to the permeability barrier, upregulating a variety of metabolic processes aimed at restoring normal barrier function. Traditional drug delivery methods, which are of limited effectiveness, view the stratum corneum as a static, but semipermeable membrane. In contrast, newer metabolically based methods, which can be deployed alone, or in conjunction with standard methods, have been shown to expand the spectrum of drugs that can be delivered transdermally in hairless mouse epidermis. Yet, while these new approaches hold great promise, if equally effective in human skin, they pose new questions about the risks of a highly permeabilized stratum corneum.",

    "title": "Recent advances in pulmonary drug delivery using large, porous inhaled particles.",
    "abstract": "The ability to deliver proteins and peptides to the systemic circulation by inhalation has contributed to a rise in the number of inhalation therapies under investigation. For most of these therapies, aerosols are designed to comprise small spherical droplets or particles of mass density near 1 g/cm3 and mean geometric diameter between approximately 1 and 3 micron, suitable for particle penetration into the airways or lung periphery. Studies performed primarily with liquid aerosols have shown that these characteristics of inhaled aerosols lead to optimal therapeutic effect, both for local and systemic therapeutic delivery. Inefficient drug delivery can still arise, owing to excessive particle aggregation in an inhaler, deposition in the mouth and throat, and overly rapid particle removal from the lungs by mucocilliary or phagocytic clearance mechanisms. To address these problems, particle surface chemistry and surface roughness are traditionally manipulated. Recent data indicate that major improvements in aerosol particle performance may also be achieved by lowering particle mass density and increasing particle size, since large, porous particles display less tendency to agglomerate than (conventional) small and nonporous particles. Also, large, porous particles inhaled into the lungs can potentially release therapeutic substances for long periods of time by escaping phagocytic clearance from the lung periphery, thus enabling therapeutic action for periods ranging from hours to many days.",

Considerable efforts have been directed at understanding and mimicking the various processes involved in the targeting, activation, and DNA cleavage associated with these natural products. This review summarizes the main contributions to the field, with particular emphasis on work from our laboratories. Highlights include studies of the Bergman reaction, which is central to the mechanism of action of enediynes, the design and chemical synthesis of a number of these systems, and biological studies with selected molecules.

    "abstract": "Amphotericin B (AmB), the drug of choice for the treatment of most systemic fungal infections, is marketed under the trademark Fungizone, as an AmB-deoxycholate complex suitable for intravenous administration. The association between AmB and deoxycholate is relatively weak; therefore, dissociation occurs in the blood. The drug itself interacts with both mammalian and fungal cell membranes to damage cells, but the greater susceptibility of fungal cells to its effects forms the basis for its clinical usefulness. The ability of the drug to form stable complexes with lipids has allowed the development of new formulations of AmB based on this property. Several lipid-based formulations of the drug which are more selective in damaging fungal or parasitic cells than mammalian cells and some of which also have a better therapeutic index than Fungizone have been developed. In vitro investigations have led to the conclusion that the increase in selectivity observed is due to the selective transfer of AmB from lipid complexes to fungal cells or to the higher thermodynamic stability of lipid formulations. Association with lipids modulates AmB binding to lipoproteins in vivo, thus influencing tissue distribution and toxicity. For example, lipid complexes of AmB can be internalized by macrophages, and the macrophages then serve as a reservoir for the drug. Furthermore, stable AmB-lipid complexes are much less toxic to the host than Fungizone and can therefore be administered in higher doses. Experimentally, the efficacy of AmB-lipid formulations compared with Fungizone depends on the animal model used. Improved therapeutic indices for AmB-lipid formations have been demonstrated in clinical trials, but the definitive trials leading to the selection of an optimal formulation and therapeutic regimen have not been done.",

    "abstract": "The pharmacologic tailoring guidelines of the World Health Organization represent the accepted treatment algorithm for the management of cancer-related pain syndromes. Unfortunately, the guidelines are only effective in 70% to 90% of patients, leaving a substantial population with intractable pain. In fact, recent surveys have shown that, in the United States, only 50% of hospitalized terminally ill patients die comfortably. When patients do not respond to the WHO guidelines, practitioners should abandon the therapy and not the patient. Interventional pain management approaches including intraspinal delivery of analgesics may be an effective alternative. Before a more permanent system for intraspinal therapy is implemented, a trial must be performed to assure efficacy, rule out toxicity, and establish that the positive response to the intrathecal agent trialed is not due to placebo effects. An external drug delivery system is appropriate if the patient has less than 3 months to live. If the patient is expected to survive more than 3 months, a totally implanted system is appropriate and cost-effective. Although morphine remains the gold standard for intrathecal pain therapy, other opioids such as fentanyl, hydromorphone, sufentanil, and meperidine are now being used in patients who do not tolerate morphine. Nonopioid agents for intrathecal use in patients who have pain syndromes that are poorly responsive to opioids include local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine, and clonidine.",

    "abstract": "Peptide nucleic acids, or PNAs, are oligonucleotide analogs in which the phosphodiester backbone is replaced with a polyamide structure. First synthesized less than 10 years ago, they have received great attention due to their several favorable properties, including resistance to nuclease and protease digestion, stability in serum and cell extracts, and their high affinity for RNA and single and double-stranded DNA targets. Although initially designed and demonstrated to function as antisense and antigene reagents that inhibit both transcription and translation by steric hindrance, more recent applications have included gene activation by synthetic promoter formation and mutagenesis of chromosomal targets. Most notably for gene delivery, they have been used to specifically label plasmids and act as adapters to link synthetic peptides or ligands to the DNA. Thus, their great potential lies in the ability to attach specific targeting peptides to plasmids to circumvent such barriers to gene transfer as cell-targeting or nuclear localization, thereby increasing the efficacy of gene therapy.",

    "title": "Depot haloperidol decanoate for schizophrenia.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia is the antipsychotic group of drugs. These are usually given orally but compliance with medication given by this route may be difficult to quantify. Problems with treatment adherence are common. The development of depot injections in the 1960s gave rise to their extensive use as a means of long-term maintenance treatment. Haloperidol decanoate is one depot drug available in clinical practice.OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of haloperidol decanoate versus oral anti-psychotics and other depot antipsychotic preparations for people with schizophrenia in terms of clinical, social and economic outcomes.SEARCH STRATEGY: Relevant trials were identified by searching Biological Abstracts (1982-1998), Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 1998), Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (June 1998), EMBASE (1980-1998), MEDLINE (1966-1998) and PsycLIT (1974-1998). References of all identified trials were also inspected for more studies.SELECTION CRITERIA: All relevant randomised trials focusing on people with schizophrenia where haloperidol decanoate, oral anti-psychotics or other depot preparations were compared. Outcomes such as death, clinically significant change in global function, mental state, relapse, hospital admission, adverse effects and acceptability of treatment were sought.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Studies were reliably selected, quality rated and data extracted. For dichotomous data Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (OR) with the 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Where possible, the number needed to treat statistic (NNT) was calculated. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Normal continuous data were summated using the weighted mean difference (WMD). Scale data were presented only for those tools that had attained pre-specified levels of quality.MAIN RESULTS: In a haloperidol decanoate versus placebo comparison, two small studies reported that significantly fewer people on depot left early (OR 0.09 CI 0.03-0.21, NNT 2 CI 1-3) or experienced no important improvement in mental state (OR 0. 04 CI 0.01-0.15). Zississ (1982) suggested that those taking haloperidol decanoate would need less additional antipsychotic medication (OR 0.14 Cl 0.04-0.55, NNT 2 CI 1-5). Haloperidol decanoate was compared to oral haloperidol in a single trial that showed no differences in global impression, mental state or side effects ( approximately approximately Zuardi 1983 approximately approximately , n=22). Compliance with medication was not reported in this study. Eight trials compared haloperidol decanoate to other depot neuroleptics and again no differences were found for the outcomes of death, global impression, mental state, behaviour, or side effects.REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Haloperidol decanoate may have a substantial effect in improving the symptoms and behaviour associated with schizophrenia in comparison to placebo, but data are remarkably sparse. There are no discernible differences between the depot form of haloperidol and its oral equivalent. For those needing and willing to take the drug, the means of administration is then a matter of individual choice and clinical judgement. As there are no clear differences between haloperidol decanoate and other depots, the choice of depot medication could also be individually tailored and patient preference exercised. Well-conducted and reported randomised trials are needed comparing haloperidol decanoate with other depots but the comparison of haloperidol decanoate to oral antipsychotics is a priority.",

Approaches for local, intravascular, site-specific delivery include 1) direct deposition of therapeutic agents into the vessel wall through an intravascular delivery system; 2) systemic administration of inactive agents followed by local activation; and 3) systemic administration of fusion toxins that have a specific affinity to proliferating smooth muscle cells at the angioplasty site. In addition to conventional drugs, new therapeutic agents based on molecular mechanisms, including recombinant genes and antisense oligonucleotides, are now under investigation. Although development of intravascular drug delivery devices, including those tailored to accommodate novel therapeutic agents, offers new treatment options for restenosis and other vascular diseases, certain issues that currently limit the safety and efficacy of these approaches remain to be addressed.",

    "abstract": "The small airways constitute one of the least understood areas of the lungs. They play a role in many lung diseases, and small airway pathology results in significant morbidity New approaches to their evaluation may provide insights into this major area of lung disease. Asthma is well recognized as a disease of both large and small airways. Physiological and pathological evidence, from techniques such as post-mortem tissue histological analysis, induced sputum and transbronchial biopsies, has reinforced the concept of the involvement of the entire bronchial tree n the inflammatory process in asthma, In addition to describing the airway pathology in asthma, th s review focuses on the pathogenesis and role of small airway obstruction n other diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), sarcoidosis and obliterative bronchiolitis (OB). COPD is characterized by the presence of airflow obstruction resulting from lesions in the small airways. In addition, features compatible with small airways disease are common in IPF, sarcoidosis and OB. Recent advances in pulmonary imaging, such as high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with hyperpolarized 3He, have allowed non-invasive reproducible measurements of structure-function relationships to be made for the small airways. These techniques have great potential for diagnosing changes in small airway function and for assessing responses to treatment. New insights into the contribution of small airways to a range of lung diseases may lead to the development of therapies targeted at this part of the bronchial anatomy.",

    "abstract": "Three cases are presented where modified chitins have been extensively administered to volunteers, as dressings for wounded soft and bone tissues, as anticholesterolemic dietary foods, and in the controlled delivery of anti-inflammatory drugs. The interactions of the modified chitins with human enzymes is critically examined. In the context of drug carrier resorption and wound healing, chitooligomers and monomers, generated by lysozyme, N-acetylglucosaminidase and human chitinase, activate macrophages and stimulate fibroblasts, respectively; the effects are production of smooth, vascularized and physiologically normal tissues. In the dietary food area, lipase, amylase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, glucokinase and the enzymes of prostaglandin synthesis are involved in the oral administration of chitosan: lipid adsorption is depressed mainly because of the physical form of the chitosan-lipid aggregates, which are unsuitable as substrates. When chitosan is used as a drug carrier, chitosan-drug complexes are present. The uniqueness of chitosan among polysaccharides is underlined in terms of susceptibility to enzymatic depolymerization, cationicity, supply of cell-activating oligomers, and supply of N-acetylglucosamine for rebuilding of other biopolymers. Advances in molecular recognition and biocompatibility are also presented.",

Randomized controlled trials were selected, when available. Also included are guidelines (Canadian), non-blinded trials, systematic reviews, and population-based studies.MAIN MESSAGE: Selecting an appropriate way to deliver medication is important in acute migraine therapy. The parenteral route has advantages, such as rapid onset, greater efficacy, and the possibility of use during nausea and vomiting. Disadvantages include local site discomfort, inconvenience, and patients' dislike of needles. Most patients prefer oral therapy, but gastric stasis and nausea and vomiting during a migraine attack might limit its use. The intranasal route usually provides fairly rapid onset, but side effects, such as disturbances in taste, can occur. The rectal route is another option, but absorption is sometimes erratic, rectal irritation can occur, and few migraine medications are available in rectal formulation.CONCLUSION: Selection of appropriate medications and suitable delivery systems for individual patients, based on the characteristics of their attacks (e.g., severity, speed of progression to severe intensity, degree of associated symptoms), ease of administration, and patient preference, will optimize therapy for acute migraine attacks.",

Current efforts to overcome these difficulties in order to deliver metabolic hormones (insulin, calcitonin, thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] and growth hormones) systemically, to induce systemic responses (immunoglobulins, cyclosporin A [CsA], recombinant-methionyl human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [r-huG-CSF], pancreatic islet autoantigen) and to modulate other biological processes via the lung are reviewed. Safety aspects of pulmonary peptide and protein administration are also discussed.",

    "title": "Therapeutic uses of antioxidant liposomes.",
    "abstract": "This chapter focuses on the use of antioxidant liposomes in the general area of free radical biology and medicine. The term antioxidant liposome is relatively new and refers to liposomes containing lipid-soluble chemical antioxidants, water-soluble chemical antioxidants, enzymatic antioxidants, or combinations of these various antioxidants. The role of antioxidants in health and disease has been extensively discussed, and many excellent reviews and books are available (–3). Antioxidant liposomes hold great promise in the treatment of many diseases in which oxidative stress plays a prominent role. Oxidative stress is a physiological condition in which the production of damaging free radicals exceeds the in vivo capacity of antioxidant protection mechanisms to prevent pathophysiology. Free radicals are molecules with unpaired electrons, often highly reactive and damaging to biological systems. The biological membranes of subcellular organelles are a major site of free radical damage but proteins and DNA are also significant targets. Moreover, free radicals can alter cellular signal transduction pathways and stimulate the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines. Oxygen radicals and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) arise from the single electron reductions of oxygen.",

The goal is to identify optimal methods for presenting target antigens to the immune system in a manner that will elicit immune responses appropriate for protection against, or treatment of, a specific disease. Several different approaches to this general goal have been developed, some are empirical and remain poorly understood, others are more rational, being based, for example, on mimicking natural infections in vivo or on targeting particular features of the immune system. This article will review three categories of delivery systems: (i) adjuvants and formulations; (ii) antigen vectors, including live attenuated micro-organisms and synthetic vectors; and (iii) novel devices for vaccine administration.

However, many oligonucleotide classes are polyanions and cannot passively transit the cell membrane. Thus, the use of naked oligonucleotides for antisense purposes poses some rather stringent challenges, and it is not a trivial task to appropriately interpret the data derived from experiments in which they have been used. Multiple methods have been developed to improve intracellular, and in particular, intranuclear oligonucleotide delivery, and in doing so, to maximize the performance of the antisense technologies that are currently available. This review discusses the use of cationic lipids, protein and peptide delivery agents, and several novel chemical and viral methods that have recently been explored as delivery vehicles, focussing not only on their strengths, but also on their limitations.",

After target validation through the construction of null mutant mice, high-throughput cell-based screens can be used to identify potential drug candidates. As a result of these approaches, a number of receptors and ion channels present in sensory neurons such as voltage-gated sodium channels [sensory neuron specific (SNS) and Na channel novel] and ATP-gated (P2X3), capsaicin-gated [vanilloid receptor 1(VR1)], and proton-gated [acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC)] channels are now under investigation as potential new analgesic drug targets.",

To overcome this problem, researchers have developed strategies that involve conjugating the molecule of interest to one of a number of peptide entities that are efficiently transported across the cell membranes. In the past decade, a number of different peptide families with the ability to cross the cell membranes have been identified. Certain of these families enter the cells by a receptor-independent mechanism, are short (10-27 amino acid residues), and can deliver successfully various cargoes across the cell membrane into the cytoplasm or nucleus. Surprisingly, some of these vectors, the SynB vectors, have also shown the ability to deliver hydrophilic molecules across the blood-brain barrier, one of the major obstacles to the development of drugs to combat diseases affecting the CNS.",

In the United States, the severity of serotype O157:H7 infections in the young and the elderly has had a tremendous impact on human health, the food industry, and federal regulations regarding food safety. The implication of acidic foods as vehicles of infection has dispelled the concept that low-pH foods are safe. Further, the association of nonbovine products with outbreaks suggests that other vehicles of transmission may exist for this pathogen. In laboratory diagnosis, most microbiologic assays rely on a single phenotype to selectively isolate this pathogen. However, the increasing evidence that phenotypic variations exist among isolates in this serogroup may eventually necessitate modifications in assay procedures to detect them.",

Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), the most commonly prescribed inhaled corticosteroid for asthma therapy, is effective therapy; however currently available chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-BDP metered dose inhalers typically deliver no more than 10% of the inhaled drug to the lungs with the remainder deposited in the oropharynx. Compared with an average particle size of 3.5-4.0 microns for CFC-BDP, the new HFA-BDP formulation has an average particle size of 1.1 microns and a respirable fraction of approximately 60%. The lung deposition of 99mTc-radiolabelled HFA-BDP has been investigated in healthy volunteers and patients with asthma. Results showed that the HFA-BDP formulation reverses the pattern of distribution seen with CFC-BDP products, delivering most of the dose of inhaled steroid directly to the lungs rather than to the oropharynx and gut where it may lead to unwanted side-effects. As such, HFA-BDP is likely to achieve equivalent efficacy to existing CFC-BDP formulations with lower doses and with reduced potential for local adverse effects.",

We still, however, often cannot tell exactly where within the lung we want to target a particular medication, be it a bronchodilator or a steroid. The basic processes of aerosol deposition are readily comprehensible. Nevertheless, even under carefully supervised inhalation conditions, one can only roughly estimate where the medication is deposited. We can, however, hope to give our patients good guidance on how to make the best use of a metered-dose inhaler or a jet nebuliser.

    "abstract": "Comment in    Thorax. 2000 Apr;55(4):347-8. doi: 10.1136/thorax.55.4.345e.BACKGROUND: To study the transition from metered dose inhalers using chlorofluorocarbons as propellants (CFC-MDIs) to non-CFC containing devices, a systematic review was conducted of clinical trials which compared the delivery of salbutamol and terbutaline via CFC-MDIs and non-CFC devices.METHODS: Papers were selected by searching electronic databases (Medline, Cochrane, and BIDS) and further information and studies were sought from pharmaceutical companies. The studies were assessed for their methodological quality.RESULTS: Fifty three relevant trials were identified. Most were scientifically flawed in terms of study design, comparison of inappropriate doses, and insufficient power for the determination of therapeutic equivalence. Differences between inhaler devices were categorised according to efficacy and potency. Most trials claimed to show therapeutic equivalence, usually for the same doses from the different devices. Two commercially available salbutamol metered dose inhalers using a novel hydrofluorocarbon HFC-134a as propellant were equally as potent and efficacious as conventional CFC-MDIs, as were the Rotahaler and Clickhaler dry powder inhalers (DPIs). Evidence suggests that a dose of 200 microg salbutamol via CFC-MDI may be substituted with 200 microg and 400 microg of salbutamol via Accuhaler and Diskhaler DPIs, respectively. Terbutaline delivered via a Turbohaler DPI is equally as potent and efficacious as terbutaline delivered via a conventional CFC-MDI.CONCLUSIONS: When substituting non-CFC containing inhalers for CFC-MDIs, attention must be given to differences in inhaler characteristics which may result in variations in pulmonary function.",

    "abstract": "It has been estimated that half the annual health care budget in the United States is spent on patients suffering from tissue loss and late stage organ failure. Critical limitations inherent in traditional therapies call for novel tissue and organ replacement strategies. This paper discusses development of biomaterials for conductive, inductive and cell-based tissue replacement strategies. Biodegradable polymer scaffolds can be used as space-filling matrices for tissue development and barriers to migration of epithelial cells in tissue conductive approaches. Inductive approaches involve sustained delivery of bioactive factors, such as protein growth factors and DNA, to alter cell function in localized regions. Factors can be released from highly porous polymer scaffolds to allow factor delivery and tissue development to occur in concert. Cell-based approaches involve seeding of cells onto polymeric scaffolds in vitro and subsequent transplantation of the scaffold. New scaffold materials are being developed that address specific tissue engineering design requirements, and in some cases attempt to mimic natural extracellular matrices. These strategies together offer the possibility of predictably forming specific tissue structures, and may provide solutions to problems such as periodontal ligament detachment, alveolar bone resorption and furcation defects.",

    "abstract": "Electroporation and the associated phenomenon of electrofusion have been widely adapted as tools to a broad range of biomedical research and therapy. In this article, we summarize our adaptation of the electroporation and electrofusion technology in two fronts of cancer research and treatment. The first is genetic manipulation of hematopoietic cells for the purpose of cancer treatment. High efficiency transfection methods have been developed to transfect NK cells, peripheral blood stem cells, and bone marrow derived dendritic cells. Hybrids of tumor cells and bone marrow derived dendritic cells have been formed by electrofusion for the purpose of tumor vaccines. The second front is the use of transcutaneous electroporation to deliver anticancer drugs and vaccines across the skin. Methods to extend the upper molecular weight limit of transcutaneous electroporation have been developed. The pro-photosensitizer drug, delta-amino levulinic acid, the anticancer drug methotrexate, and peptide vaccines designed for cancer prevention and immunotherapy have been delivered transcutaneously by electroporation. These studies hold promise for the treatment of cancers in human.",

The rationale for liposome encapsulation of aminoglycosides is the possibility to increase the therapeutic index of this class of antibiotics by increasing aminoglycoside concentrations at the site of infection and/or by reducing the toxicity of these drugs. Three approaches can be distinguished: the use of liposomes as a depot formulation for local drug administration; targeting of (relatively) short circulating conventional liposomes to the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) for treating intracellular bacterial infections; and targeting of long-circulating liposomes to infectious foci localized outside the MPS.

    "abstract": "With the human genome product and continuing advances in molecular biology many therapeutic genes have been discovered. In the cardiovascular system, gene therapy has the potential to improve myocardial vascularization and ameliorate congestive heart failure. For successful development of clinical gene therapy, however, effective gene delivery vectors are needed. Ultrasound contrast agents can be used to develop new, more effective vectors for gene delivery. Ultrasound contrast agents lower the threshold for cavitation by ultrasound energy. Using physical properties of microbubbles and coating materials, genetic drugs have been incorporated into ultrasound contrast agents. Gene-bearing microbubbles can be injected IV and ultrasound energy applied to the target region. As the microbubbles enter the region of insonation, the microbubbles cavitate, locally releasing DNA. Cavitation also likely causes a local shockwave that improves cellular uptake of DNA. With transthoracic ultrasound, using commercially available diagnostic ultrasound system and an IV injection of gene-bearing microbubbles, high levels of transgene expression are observed in the insonated region of the myocardium. This new technology using microbubbles and ultrasound for gene delivery merits further study and development.",

    "abstract": "Development of nonviral gene transfer methods would be a valuable addition to the gene-therapy armamentarium, particularly for localized targeting of specific tissue volumes. Ultrasound can produce a variety of nonthermal bioeffects via acoustic cavitation including DNA delivery. Cavitation bubbles may induce cell death or transient membrane permeabilization (sonoporation) on a single cell level, as well as microvascular hemorrhage and disruption of tissue structure. Application of sonoporation for gene delivery to cells requires control of cavitation activity. Many studies have been performed using in vitro exposure systems, for which cavitation is virtually ubiquitous. In vivo, cavitation initiation and control is more difficult, but can be enhanced by cavitation nucleation agents, such as an ultrasound contrast agent. Sonoporation and ultrasonically enhanced gene delivery has been reported for a wide range of conditions including low frequency sonication (kilohertz frequencies), lithotripter shockwaves, HIFU, and even diagnostic ultrasound (megahertz frequencies). In vitro, a variety of cell lines has been successfully transfected, with concomitant cell killing. In vivo, initial applications have been to cancer gene therapy, for which cell killing can be a useful simultaneous treatment, and to cardiovascular disease. The use of ultrasound for nonviral gene delivery has been demonstrated for a robust array of in vitro and mammalian systems, which provides a fundamental basis and strong promise for development of new gene therapy methods for clinical medicine.",

    "title": "Scientific rationale for inhaled combination therapy with long-acting beta2-agonists and corticosteroids.",
    "abstract": "Comment in    Eur Respir J. 2004 May;23(5):791; author reply 791. doi: 10.1183/09031936.04.00135204.The addition of an inhaled long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) to an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) gives optimal control of asthma in most patients and two fixed combination inhalers (salmeterol/fluticasone and formoterol/budesonide) are increasingly used as a convenient controller in patients with persistent asthma. There is a strong scientific rationale for the combination of these two drug classes. ICS suppress the chronic inflammation of asthma and reduce airway hyperresponsiveness and this is achieved at low doses in most patients. LABA act on different aspects of the pathophysiology of asthma. In addition to their bronchodilator action, LABA also inhibit mast cell mediator release, plasma exudation and may reduce sensory nerve activation. Thus these two classes of drug address complementary aspects of the pathophysiology of asthma that neither drug class is able to achieve alone. There are several positive interactions between LABA and ICS. Corticosteroids increase the expression of beta2-receptors by increasing gene transcription. Experimentally this protects against the loss of beta2-receptors in response to long-term exposure to beta2-agonists. While this is unlikely to be important in bronchodilator responses to beta2-agonists, in view of the large beta-receptor reserve, it is probably important in preventing loss of beta-agonist effects on the nonbronchodilator actions of LABA discussed earlier. beta2-Agonists may potentiate the molecular mechanism of corticosteroid actions, with increased nuclear localization of glucocorticoid receptors and additive or sometimes synergistic suppression of inflammatory mediator release. Thus LABA and ICS may optimize each others beneficial actions in the airways, but the low systemic effects of these drugs do not result in any increase in adverse effects. Long-acting beta2-agonists corticosteroid inhaler therapy is therefore a logical advance and results in effective control of asthma in the majority of patients without significant adverse effects. This simplified approach to long-term asthma therapy has a strong scientific rationale.",

    "title": "[Improvement of transmucosal absorption of biologically active peptide drugs].",
    "abstract": "Peptide and protein drugs are becoming a very important class of therapeutic agents. However, the oral bioavailability of peptide and protein drugs is generally poor because they are extensively degraded by proteases in the gastrointestinal tract or impermeable through the intestinal mucosa. For the systemic delivery of the peptide and protein drugs, parenteral administration is currently required to achieve their therapeutic activities. However, this administration is poorly accepted by patients and may cause allergic reactions and serious side effects. Therefore, various approaches have been examined to overcome the delivery problems of these peptides when they are administered into the gastrointestinal tract and other mucosal sites. These approaches include (1) to use additives such as absorption enhancers and protease inhibitors, (2) to develop an administration method for peptides that can serve as an alternative to oral and injection administration, (3) to modify the molecular structure of peptide and protein drugs to produce prodrugs and analogues, and (4) to use the dosage forms to these peptide drugs. In this study, we demonstrated that the transmucosal absorption of various peptides including insulin, calcitonin, tetragastrin and thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) could be improved by the use of these approaches. Therefore, these approaches may give us basic information to improve the transmucosal absorption of peptide and protein drugs.",

Both BDP and budesonide are metabolized primarily by the liver, with one of the metabolites of BDP, 17-BMP, having greater receptor affinity than either the parent compound or budesonide, which has no active metabolites. BDP has a lower water solubility than either 17-BMP or budesonide, which have similar water solubilities. Budesonide has lower oral bioavailability than BDP; however, it is generally reported to have a longer plasma half-life than either BDP or 17-BMP. The physicochemical and pharmacokinetic profiles of inhaled BDP and budesonide provide both compounds with a favourable ratio of topical to systemic effects and support their well-established role in the treatment of asthma. The device used to deliver an inhaled corticosteroid influences the lung deposition of the drug and selection of the device should be made with an understanding of the particular advantages and disadvantages of the device for each individual patient.",

    "abstract": "Cyclodextrins are cylindrical oligosaccharides with a lipophilic central cavity and hydrophilic outer surface. They can form water-soluble complexes with lipophilic drugs, which 'hide' in the cavity. Cyclodextrins can be used to form aqueous eye drop solutions with lipophilic drugs, such as steroids and some carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. The cyclodextrins increase the water solubility of the drug, enhance drug absorption into the eye, improve aqueous stability and reduce local irritation. Cyclodextrins are useful excipients in eye drop formulations of various drugs, including steroids of any kind, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, pilocarpine, cyclosporins, etc. Their use in ophthalmology has already begun and is likely to expand the selection of drugs available as eye drops. In this paper we review the properties of cyclodextrins and their application in eye drop formulations, of which their use in the formulation of dexamethasone eye drops is an example. Cyclodextrins have been used to formulate eye drops containing corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, with levels of concentration and ocular absorption which, according to human and animal studies, are many times those seen with presently available formulations. Cyclodextrin-based dexamethasone eye drops are well tolerated in the eye and seem to provide a higher degree of bioavailability and clinical efficiency than the steroid eye drop formulations presently available. Such formulations offer the possibility of once per day application of corticosteroid eye drops after eye surgery, and more intensive topical steroid treatment in severe inflammation. While cyclodextrins have been known for more than a century, their use in ophthalmology is just starting. Cyclodextrins are useful excipients in eye drop formulations for a variety of lipophilic drugs. They will facilitate eye drop formulations for drugs that otherwise might not be available for topical use, while improving absorption and stability and decreasing local irritation.",

Based upon the information discussed above, a rational inhaler strategy could be as follows: (1) Children < or = 5 years and elderly patients are prescribed a spacer with a valve system (and a face mask for the children) for the delivery of all drugs. When they are severely obstructed, some may need a nebulizer. If the patient cannot be taught the correct use of a spacer, a nebulizer should be prescribed. (2) Children > or = 5 years and adults are prescribed a spacer or a Turbuhaler for the administration of inhaled corticosteroids and a dry powder inhaler (preferably multiple dose) or a breath-actuated MDI for other drugs. If these alternatives are not available or the patient prefers, a conventional MDI can be used (preferably not for other corticosteroids than fluticasone propionate) provided that careful tuition is given. Fluticasone dipropionate may be given by DPI, Spacer or MDI. (3) Nebulizers are mainly reserved for severe acute attacks of bronchoconstriction. With this approach, most patients can be taught effective inhaler use with a minimum of instructional time. Finally, it must always be remembered to consider the patient's wish, since prescription of an inhaler which the physician likes but the patient does not is likely to reduce compliance.",

    "abstract": "Comment on    Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Oct 15;983(21):11615-7.To improve the efficiency of liposome-mediated DNA transfer as a tool for gene therapy, we have developed a fusigenic liposome vector based on principles of viral cell fusion. The fusion proteins of hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ; also Sendai virus) are complexed with liposomes that encapsulate oligodeoxynucleotide or plasmid DNA. Subsequent fusion of HVJ-liposomes with plasma membranes introduces the DNA directly into the cytoplasm. In addition, a DNA-binding nuclear protein is incorporated into the HVJ-liposome particle to enhance plasmid transgene expression. The fusigenic viral liposome vector has proven to be efficient for the intracellular introduction of oligodeoxynucleotide, as well as intact genes up to 100 kbp, both in vitro and in vivo. Many animal tissues have been found to be suitable targets for fusigenic viral liposome DNA transfer. In the cardiovascular system, we have documented successful cytostatic gene therapy in models of vascular proliferative disease using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against cell cycle genes, double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides as \"decoys\" to trap the transcription factor E2F, and expression of a transgene encoding the constitutive endothelial cell form of nitric oxide synthase. Similar strategies are also effective for the genetic engineering of vein grafts and for the treatment of a mouse model of immune-mediated glomerular disease.",

    "title": "Novel approaches for designing 5'-O-ester prodrugs of 3'-azido-2', 3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT).",
    "abstract": "3'-Azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT, 1, zidovudine, RetrovirTM) is used to treat patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. AZT, after conversion to AZT-5'-triphosphate (AZT-TP) by cellular enzymes, inhibits HIV-reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT). The major clinical limitations of AZT are due to clinical toxicities that include bone marrow suppression, hepatic abnormalities and myopathy, absolute dependence on host cell kinase-mediated activation which leads to low activity, limited brain uptake, a short half-life of about one hour in plasma that dictates frequent administration to maintain therapeutic drug levels, low potential for metabolic activation and/or high susceptibility to catabolism, and the rapid development of resistance by HIV-1. These limitations have prompted the development of strategies for designing prodrugs of AZT. A variety of 5'-O-substituted prodrugs of AZT constitute the subject of this review. The drug-design rationale on which these approaches are based is that the ester conjugate will be converted by hydrolysis and/or enzymatic cleavage to AZT or its 5&prime;-monophosphate (AZT-MP). Most prodrug derivatives of AZT have been prepared by derivatization of AZT at its 5'-O position to provide two prominent classes of compounds that encompass: A) 5'-O-carboxylic esters derived from 1) cyclic 5'-O-carboxylic acids such as steroidal 17b-carboxylic acids, 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid, bicyclam carboxylic acid derivatives, O-acetylsalicylic acid, and carbohydrate derivatives, 2) amino acids, 3) 1, 4-dihydro-1-methyl-3-pyridinylcarboxylic acid, 4) aliphatic fatty acid analogs such as myristic acid containing a heteroatom, or without a heteroatom such as stearic acid, and 5) long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid analogs such as retinoic acid, and B) masked phosphates such as 1) phosphodiesters that include monoalkyl or monoaryl phosphate, carbohydrate, ether lipid, ester lipid, and foscarnet derivatives, 2) a variety of phosphotriesters that include dialkylphosphotriesters, diarylphosphotriesters, glycolate and lactate phosphotriesters, phosphotriester approaches using simultaneous enzymatic and chemical hydrolysis of bis(4-acyloxybenzyl) esters, bis(S-acyl-2-thioethyl) (SATE) esters, cyclosaligenyl prodrugs, glycosyl phosphotriesters, and steroidal phosphotriesters, 3) phosphoramidate derivatives, 4) dinucleoside phosphate derivatives that possess a second anti-HIV moiety such as AZT-P-ddA, AZT-P-ddI, AZTP2AZT, AZTP2ACV), and 5) 5'-hydrogen phosphonate and 5'-methylene phosphonate derivatives of AZT. In these prodrugs, the conjugating moiety is linked to AZT via a 5'-O-ester or 5'-O-phosphate group. 5'-O-Substituted AZT prodrugs have been designed with the objectives of improving anti-HIV activity, enhancing blood-brain barrier penetration, modifying pharmacokinetic properties to increase plasma half-life and improving drug delivery with respect to site-specific targeting or drug localization. Bypassing the first phosphorylation step, regulating transport and conferring sustained release of AZT prolong its duration of action, decrease toxicity and improve patient acceptability. The properties of these prodrugs and their anti-HIV activities are now reviewed.",

    "title": "Cationic lipids, phosphatidylethanolamine and the intracellular delivery of polymeric, nucleic acid-based drugs (review).",
    "abstract": "Polymeric, nucleic acid drugs must be protected from endogenous nucleases and delivered to target cell nuclei in order to maximize their activity. Constructs expressing therapeutic genes, antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes can be delivered into cells by viral vectors, but concerns over safety and clinical utility have led to research into the development of alternative, non-viral delivery systems. Antisense and ribozyme drug development has focused upon modifications to the natural oligonucleotide chemistry which make the molecules resistant to nuclease degradation. These novel oligonucleotides cannot be generated by transgenes and must be administered in similar fashion to conventional drugs. However, oligonucleotides cannot cross membranes by passive diffusion and intracellular delivery for these drugs is very inefficient. Here we review the recent advances in forming lipid-DNA particles designed to mimic viral delivery of DNA. Most evidence now supports the hypothesis that lipid-DNA drugs enter target cells by endocytosis and disrupt the endosomal membrane, releasing nucleic acid into the cytoplasm. The mechanisms of particle formation and endosome disruption are not well understood. Cationic lipids are employed to provide an electrostatic interaction between the lipid carrier and polyanionic nucleic acids, and they are critical for efficient packaging of the drugs into a form suitable for systemic administration. However, their role in endosome disruption and other aspects of successful delivery leading to gene expression or inhibition of mRNA translation are less clear. We discuss the propensity of lipid-nucleic acid particles to undergo lipid mixing and fusion with adjacent membranes, and how phosphatidylethanolamine and other lipids may act as factors capable of disrupting bilayer structure and the endosomal pathway. Finally, we consider the challenges that remain in bringing nucleic acid based drugs into the realm of clinical reality.",

    "abstract": "The advent of sophisticated biotechnological processes has generated an interest in peptide and protein pharmaceuticals. However, the rapid developments in biotechnology are not matched by the developments in the delivery of these molecules. Presently, most of the peptides and proteins are delivered by parenteral route due to their poor oral bioavailability. The inherent discomforts associated with the parenteral therapy has prompted investigations into other nonparenteral routes and drug delivery techniques. Transdermal iontophoresis is one such technique showing good promise in the controlled and enhanced delivery of peptides and proteins. It offers noninvasive, continuous, pulsatile delivery as well as preprogramed complex dosing regimens. Miniature battery powered and wearable patches for peptides and proteins are expected to be on the market by the turn of this century. In continuation of our earlier review, this review explores the potential of transdermal iontophoresis for the delivery of peptides and proteins with the main focus on the suitability of the technique along with the factors to be considered in the design of this drug delivery system and its future prospects.",

    "title": "Zuclopenthixol decanoate for schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a clear link between stopping antipsychotic medications and a relapse of psychotic symptoms. A series of long-acting intra-muscular preparations has been developed since the 1960s in the hope of reducing the frequency of relapse and, hence, overall disability. These depot preparations, active for weeks at a time, are frequently used for those who find taking oral medication on a regular basis difficult or unacceptable. It has, however, been a consistent concern that any reduction in relapse rate afforded by depot preparations may be offset by an increase in adverse effects such as drug-induced movement disorders.OBJECTIVES: To compare zuclopenthixol decanoate to oral zuclopenthixol and other antipsychotic preparations for the treatment of schizophrenia and similar serious mental illness.SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1982-1998), CINAHL (1982-1998), The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 1998), The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (April 1998), EMBASE (1980-1998), MEDLINE (1966-1998), and PsycLIT (1974-1998) were searched. References of all eligible studies were searched for further trials. The manufacturer of zuclopenthixol was contacted.SELECTION CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria were that the clinical study should be randomised, focus on people with schizophrenia or other serious mental illness with psychotic symptoms, and compare the use of zuclopenthixol decanoate to oral zuclopenthixol or other antipsychotic preparations.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data was extracted independently by two reviewers (EC, MF). Authors of trials were contacted for additional and missing data. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of homogenous dichotomous data were calculated with the Peto method. Where possible the number needed to treat (NNT) and its 95% confidence interval was also calculated.MAIN RESULTS: Four studies relating to zuclopenthixol decanoate were included. All compared zuclopenthixol decanoate with other depot preparations. Zuclopenthixol decanoate prevented or postponed relapses when compared to other depots (NNT 8, CI 5-53). However, zuclopenthixol decanoate may induce more adverse effects (NNH 5, CI 3-31) although it decreases need for anticholinergic medication when compared to a group of other depot preparations (NNT 9, CI 5-38). For the risk of leaving the study early, there was also a trend for benefit to those allocated to zuclopenthixol decanoate. None of the studies reported outcomes on service utilisation, costs, or quality of life.REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Choice of which depot to use must always take into account clinical judgement and the preferences of the recipients of care and their carers. Limited trial data suggests, however, that there are real differences between zuclopenthixol decanoate and other depots and these differences largely favour the former. This review highlights the need for good controlled clinical trials to fully address the effects of zuclopenthixol decanoate for those with schizophrenia. Future studies should report service utilisation data, as well as satisfaction with care and economic outcomes. Duration of such trials should be of a longer duration than the included studies (12 months or more).",

    "title": "[Development of transdermal formulation of tulobuterol for the treatment of bronchial asthma].",
    "abstract": "beta 2-Adrenergic agonists have been widely used to treat patients with asthma. Usually, oral dosage forms of beta 2-agonists have been used, but side effects such as palpitation and tremor have been reported because of excessive serum levels around Tmax. It is said that circadian variations exist in the manifestation of asthma with maximum incidence of asthma attacks in early morning at around 4 a.m., the so-called morning dip. Chronotherapy for asthma based on circadian rhythm should be more efficient and have a lower frequency of side effects. Accordingly we developed a transdermal delivery system of the beta 2-agonist tulobuterol adapted to the circadian rhythm. The system is designed to administer the appropriate dose of the drug at an optimal time using the so-called Crystal Reservoir System. The superiority of the transdermal formulation of tulobuterol over the current therapy using oral formulations of beta 2-stimulants was indicated by its excellent pharmacokinetic profile, and confirmed by the results of clinical trials. This formulation is the first transdermal chrono-delivery system reported anywhere in the world, and is expected to provide more effective and safe treatment of asthma and related diseases not only in adults, but also especially in children.",

    "abstract": "This review addresses the question of whether the different gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists in clinical use might have different impacts, related to their chemical structure, delivery system and dose. Impact was investigated in benign gynecological disorders, i.e. endometriosis and leiomyoma. Arguments are presented indicating that a difference in impact of different analogs can be expected. All currently used intranasal, daily subcutaneous and depot preparations finally give rise to low levels of serum estradiol. The number of days before the first ovulatory menstruation after discontinuation of GnRH agonist treatment is remarkably constant. Four weeks after the last impact of the agonist, there is resumption of follicle growth. This phenomenon is independent of chemical structure, delivery system and dose. One should realize, however, that it generally takes about 30 days before the impact of a depot preparation disappears. Consequently, the impact of a depot preparation lasts 4 weeks longer than that of an otherwise applied agonist. Thus resumption of pituitary activity after discontinuation of a depot formulation takes 4 weeks longer than after discontinuation of non-depot formulations. All agonists have an impressive effect on endometriosis, independent of their chemical structure and delivery system. However, there are no studies comparing different agonists with the same delivery system in comparable endometriosis groups. Similarly, all agonists considerably reduce myoma volume, independently of their chemical structure and delivery system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Fluorophotometry measurements of fluorescein concentrations in the anterior segment were performed with the Fluorotron Master II (Ocumetrics, USA) before and +15, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after application.RESULTS: At all times anterior chamber fluorescein concentration was greater in the lyophysilate treated eye than the solution treated eye. The magnitude of this difference ranged from 2-5.3 times and was statistically significant.CONCLUSION: The greater intraocular bioavailability of fluorescein from the lyophilisate relative to the solution suggests that it may be a useful method for delivering substances to the eye.",

Under controlled laboratory conditions (monthly challenge with tsetse flies infected with Trypanosoma congolense) the protection period in SRD treated cattle could be extended by a factor 2.8 (for ethidium) up to 4.2 (for ISMM) as compared to animals treated intramuscularly with the same drugs. Using a competitive drug ELISA ISMM concentrations were detected up to 330 days after the implantation of the SRDs, whereas after i.m. injection the drug was no longer present three to four months post treatment. Two field trials carried out in Mali under heavy tsetse challenge showed that the cumulative infection rate was significantly lower in the ISMM-SRD implanted cattle than in those which received ISMM intramuscularly. Using ethidium SRD, however, contradictory results were obtained in field trials in Zambia and in Mali. The potential advantages and inconvenients of the use of SRDs are discussed and suggestions are made in order to further improve the currently available devices.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease and its exact cause and pathophysiological process remain unclear. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes, macrophages and T lymphocytes are considered to be the major contributors in the pathophysiological process of RA; however, an increasing number of papers have drawn attention to the potential role of mast cells (MCs) in the process. In an animal model of RA, we reported an increase in MC numbers in the arthritic region, which agreed with the observation in human RA. In addition, a good correlation between the number of MCs and the development of disease was observed. However, there has been little experimental or clinical evidence of the beneficial effects of the modification of MC activity on the pathogenesis of RA and this is the weak point of the hypothesis. We therefore studied the effects of a MC-stabilizing compound, cromoglicate lisetil (CL), which is an orally deliverable prodrug of cromolyn sodium, on the RA disease model. The MC-stabilizer had efficacy in a mouse model. The beneficial effects of CL in this animal model further suggested the contribution of MCs in the pathophysiological process of RA. Concerning the contributive mechanism of MC on the pathogenesis of RA, our results using a disease model suggested that activation of MC chymase and matrix metalloproteinases might be involved. MC is now considered to be one of the targets of RA treatment.",

Eur Respir J. 2001 May;17(5):1053. doi: 10.1183/09031936.01.17510530.A randomized two-part study was conducted in order to determine the efficacy of theophylline in the treatment of acute mountain sickness during fast ascent to altitudes >2,500 m. Fourteen healthy male subjects participated in a randomized single-blind placebo-controlled crossover study carried out in a decompression chamber (simulated altitude 4,500 m). A second randomized single-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted at a high-altitude research laboratory (3,454 m) and included 21 healthy male subjects. The study medication was either 375 mg oral slow-release theophylline (250 mg if <70 kg) or a matched placebo tablet taken twice daily. The acute mountain sickness score (AMSS) was assessed three times a day, beginning 18 h prior to altitude exposure and continuing for 18 h after altitude exposure. In addition, measurements of respiratory frequency, pulse rate, oxygen saturation and arterial blood gas levels were performed. Acute mountain sickness was significantly reduced by theophylline during the decompression chamber study (mean+/-SD 1.2+/-0.9) with placebo versus 3.6+/-0.8 with theophylline; p=0.03). During the high-altitude study, subjects with theophylline showed a significantly lower AMSS on arrival and after 18 h at altitude (0.6 versus 2.3, p=0.03). Oxygenation was improved in both parts of the study. In conclusion, oral slow-release theophylline improves acute mountain sickness.",

    "abstract": "Gene therapy using viral vectors has to date failed to reveal its definitive clinical usefulness. Cell encapsulation technology represents an alternative, nonviral approach for the delivery of biologically active compounds to tumors. This strategy involves the use of genetically engineered producer cells that secrete a protein with therapeutic potential. The cells are encapsulated in an immunoisolating material that makes them suitable for transplantation. The capsules, or bioreactors, permit the release of recombinant proteins that may assert their effects in the tumor microenvironment. During the last decades, there has been significant progress in the development of encapsulation technologies that comprise devices for both macro- and microencapsulation. The polysaccharide alginate is the most commonly used material for cell encapsulation and is well tolerated by various tissues. A wide spectrum of cells and tissues has been encapsulated and implanted, both in animals and humans, indicating the general applicability of this approach for both research and medical purposes, including CNS malignancies. Gliomas most frequently recur at the resection site. To provide local and sustained drug delivery, the bioreactors can be implanted in the brain parenchyma or in the ventricular system. The development of comprehensive analyses of geno- and phenotypic profiles of a tumor (genomics and proteomics) may provide new and important guidelines for choosing the optimal combination of bioreactors and recombinant proteins for therapeutic use.",

    "title": "Polyanions--a lost chance in the fight against HIV and other virus diseases?",
    "abstract": "Polyanions are known to exhibit potent antiviral activity in vitro, and may represent future therapeutic agents. This review summarizes literature reports, pertinent to anionic polymers as antiviral agents. The in vitro antiviral effects of numerous polyanionic compounds (sulphated polysaccharides, negatively charged serum albumin and milk proteins, synthetic sulphated polymers, polymerized anionic surfactants and polyphosphates) are described. This class of antiviral agent exhibits several unique properties that are not shared by other presently known antiviral agents: (i) a remarkable broad-spectrum antiviral activity against HIV-1, HIV-2 and a series of other enveloped viruses; (ii) the ability to inhibit syncytium formation between HIV-infected and normal CD4 T lymphocytes, a mechanism that drastically enhances HIV infectivity; and (iii) a low induction of viral drug-resistance. There is increasing evidence that polyanions interfere with the fusion process, a vital step in the viral replication cycle. The inhibition of virus-cell fusion appears to be the source of the antiviral activity of polyanions. In vivo, the pharmacological properties of polyanions result in a low bioavailability of the drugs to their viral targets, and hence a poor antiviral activity in vivo. It is suggested that polyanions must be used in combination with drug delivery systems in order to become therapeutically useful antiviral agents. Some drug delivery systems are briefly discussed.",

The two treatments were bioequivalent, with comparable rates (Cmax of one 20 mg tablet was 109% of two 10 mg tablets; 90% confidence limits: 98.4%-120%) and extents (AUC0-infinity: 107%; 100%-114%) of absorption. In addition, no significant differences between tablets were found for mean values of Tmax, T/12abs, or T/12elim. Correlations between plasma oxycodone concentrations and most pharmacodynamic measures were significant. The strongest correlations were observed for pupil size (r = -0.53) and subjects' assessment of drug effect (r = 0.53), with changes in plasma concentration accounting for more than 25% of the observed changes in these variables. This study demonstrated bioequivalence of two 10 mg and one 20 mg CR oxycodone tablet, with significant correlation between plasma oxycodone concentrations and pharmacodynamic effects in normal volunteers.",

    "abstract": "The budesonide dose delivered to the patient from three different spacer devices (Nebuhaler = 750 ml, Aerochamber = 140 ml, and Babyspacer = 260 ml) was assessed by measuring the budesonide dose deposited on a filter inserted between the spacer outlet and the mouth of the patient. Twenty children aged 10-25 months were given a single dose of 200 micrograms budesonide from each spacer device in a randomised crossover study. All spacers had a facemask attached and a one way valve system. The children breathed through the inhalation system for 30 seconds. Furthermore, the minute ventilation of the children through a tightly fitting facemask was measured. The filter dose of budesonide was significantly lower after Aerochamber treatment (39.4 micrograms, range 19-67 micrograms) than after Nebuhaler (53.5 micrograms, range 34-88 micrograms) and Babyspacer (55.5 micrograms, range 39-76 micrograms) treatment. The minute ventilation of the children varied from 1.4 l/min to 7.0 l/min (mean 5.0 l/min). This was sufficient to empty all spacers within the 30 seconds of inhalation. It is concluded that spacer volume does not seem to be so important for children aged 10-25 months as long as spacers with a volume lower than 750 ml are used.",

As carriers for a variety of agents, liposomes can allow successful delivery of agents that may be subject to rapid degradation in the serum and can modify the toxicity profile. In general, liposomes have demonstrated an ability to attenuate toxicities by their different pharmacokinetic profile and pattern of distribution. Differences in the constitution of the liposome can greatly affect the pharmacokinetic profile resulting in different patterns of toxicity. Characteristics such as size, charge, composition, and integrity can affect performance of the liposome. Liposome encapsulation of doxorubicin has been shown to reduce cardiac toxicity.

The aim was to obtain CFC-free pMDIs which are equivalent, in terms of safety and efficacy, to the previous CFC devices at the same dose. When beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) and budesonide Modulite formulations were compared to the equivalent CFC products there was no significant difference in morning serum cortisol or urinary cortisol excretion, at the maximum recommended daily dose (2000 micrograms or 1600 micrograms respectively). Single dose pharmacokinetic studies in both healthy volunteers and asthmatic patients compared systemic exposure (B17MP levels) for BDP-CFC with BDP Modulite and extrafine BDP-HFA (QVAR). B17MP levels for BDP-CFC and BDP Modulite were comparable, but substantially less than that seen with extrafine BDP-HFA. After 6 weeks of treatment in asthmatic patients, B17MP AUC after inhalation of BDP (1000 micrograms twice-daily) from BDP Modulite was comparable with that obtained after BDP-CFC (Becloforte). Plasma profile of BDP and B17MP were similar after inhalation from BDP Modulite with standard actuator or delivered via a spacer, suggesting that pulmonary delivery of BDP to the lung is similar with both actuators.",

    "abstract": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have commonly been associated with upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract side effects including a high incidence of gastric and duodenal ulceration. Recent reports implicate NSAID use and mucosal injury in the small and large intestine. A trend in NSAID development has been an attempt to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce the severity of upper GI side effects through modified release dosage forms of NSAIDs such as enteric-coating (EC) or sustained release (SR) formulations. It is possible that modified release formulations may increase the exposure of active drug to the mucosa distally to the duodenal bulb, and thereby increase toxicity to distal GI regions where the effects are difficult to monitor. A systematic literature review through Medline, Embase, and Index Medicus was made to identify toxicological effects induced by modified release formulations of NSAIDs in the small and large intestine. An analysis of the identified toxicological effects of these formulations was made. SR and EC NSAID use has been associated with both small and large intestinal bleeding, anaemia, strictures, ulcerations, perforations, and death. Modified release NSAIDs may cause significant morbidity in some patients. NSAID modified release delivery systems are not guarantors of GI safety. Since SR and EC NSAIDs are widely prescribed and some EC products are available without a prescription, heightened awareness of these toxicological manifestations in more distal sites of the GI tact may reduce morbidity.",

Compared with biologic particulates, such as live or attenuated bacterial vectors and viral vectors, synthetic particulates may be expected to ease the hurdles of quality assurance and validation in vaccine development and production and shorten the time for approval and to the market. The ability of synthetic antigen-loaded particulates to elicit strong immune responses, even with low amounts of antigen and to weakly immunogenic epitopes, is suggested to be due to their efficient cross-talk with the most potent antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells. Moreover, the potential of particulates for intracellular delivery and directing intracellular trafficking of antigens has evolved as a promising opportunity to target the major histocompatibility complex I pathway. In summary, synthetic particulate vaccine delivery systems are likely to play an increasingly active role in enhancing or even enabling the immunostimulating effect of antigens upon direct interaction with the target cells.",

Data pertaining to catheter-related complications were collected at implant and at specified times during the follow-up period. Catheter implantation characteristics that might affect complications were assessed. Two hundred nine patients were studied at 22 participating centers, with 1764 cumulative patient-months of catheter experience. Forty-nine catheter system complications occurred in 37 patients (7 complications related to the catheter itself, and 42 complications related to the implantation procedure). The 9-month complication-free \"survival\" rate was 78.9% overall (95.5% for the catheter itself). No specific catheter implantation characteristics were associated with the occurrence of complications. These data indicate that the incidence of complications for a one-piece catheter system is similar to that of commercially available two-piece systems, and highlight the need for careful surgical technique during implantation.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian circadian pacemaker resides in the paired suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Clock genes are the genes that control the circadian rhythms of physiology and behavior. The effectiveness and toxicity of many drugs vary depending on dosing time associated with 24-h rhythms of biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes under the control of the circadian clock. However, many drugs are still administered without regard to the time of day. Identification of a rhythmic marker for selecting dosing time will lead to improved progress and diffusion of chronopharmacotherapy. The monitoring of rhythmic markers may be useful in choosing the most appropriate time of day for administration of drugs and may increase their therapeutic effects and/or reduce their side effects. On the other hand, several drugs can cause alterations in 24-h rhythms, leading to illness and altered homeostatic regulation. Here, we show the disruptive effect of interferon on the rhythm of locomotor activity, body temperature, and clock gene mRNA expression in the periphery and SCN. The alteration of the clock function, a new concept of adverse effects, can be overcome by devising a dosing schedule that minimizes adverse drug effects on clock function. Furthermore, to produce new rhythmicity by manipulating the conditions of living organs using rhythmic administration of altered feeding schedules or several drugs appears to lead to the new concept of chronopharmacotherapy. One approach to increasing the efficiency of pharmacotherapy is administering drugs at times during which they are best effective and/or tolerated.",

Previous histopathologic studies on eyes containing such implants have been limited by the necessity of removing the device before processing. Microtome sectioning of hard plastics within paraffin-embedded blocks is infeasible, and the anatomic relations of implant to eye are destroyed.METHODS: The authors studied four eyes from three patients who had undergone implant insertion. Globes with implants in place were fixed in neutral 10% formation, embedded in methylmethacrylate, sectioned on a special microtome, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin.RESULTS: After methacrylate embedding, the precise anatomic relations of the implant to the neighboring uveoscleral coats were preserved. In two eyes, the suture tab of the implant protruded through the sclera, exiting subconjunctivally. In two eyes, the implant was totally intravitreal. In all patients, the device was supported by fibrous tissue which emanated from a surgical coloboma of the pars plana ciliaris. Focal granulomatous inflammation adjoined suture and implant materials but no other inflammation or deleterious effects on the ocular structures were noted.CONCLUSION: This report is the first to document the intraocular histopathology of the ganciclovir implant. The subconjunctival location, enhancing the potential for endophthalmitis, may be avoided by trimming of the suture tab close to the anchoring suture and not tying it too tightly. Methylmethacrylate embedding is a useful technique for preserving the microanatomy of intraocular implants.",

    "abstract": "Parasites may employ particular strategies of eluding an immune response by taking advantage of those mechanisms that normally guarantee immunological self-tolerance. Much in the way as it occurs during the establishment of self-tolerance, live pathogens may induce clonal deletion, functional inactivation (anergy) and immunosuppression. At this latter level, it appears that certain pathogens produce immunosuppressive cytokine-like mediators or provoke the host to secrete cytokines that will compromise the anti-parasite immune response. It appears that immune responses that preferentially involve T helper 1 cells (secretors of interleukin-2-and interferon-gamma) tend to be protective, whereas T helper 2 cells (secretors of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10), a population that antagonizes T helper cells, mediate disease susceptibility and are involved in immunopathological reactions. Cytokines produced by T helper 2 cells mediate many symptoms of infection, including eosinophilia, mastocytosis, hyperimmunoglobulinemia, and elevated IgE levels. Administration of IL-2 and IFN-gamma has beneficial effects in many infections mediated by viruses, bacteria, and protozoa. The use of live vaccinia virus might be an avenue for the treatment of or the vaccination against infection. We have found that a vaccinia virus expressing the gene for human IL-2, though attenuated, precipitates autoimmune disease in immunodeficient, athymic mice. Thus, although T helper 1 cytokines may have desired immunostimulatory properties, they also may lead to unwarranted autoaggressive responses.",

    "title": "Eric Hall pointed out many years ago that in hyperthermia the biology is with us, but the physics is against us. Over the years the basic truth in that statement has not wavered. Our best evidence suggests that temperature distributions are 1-1.5 degrees C too low, on average. However, investigations in biology may lead to sensitization of tumours to hyperthermia, even with the temperatures that are already achievable in the clinic. Biologists are now starting to realize that more studies need to be done in the temperature range between 37 and 42 degrees C, since this is the range that is most often reached in the clinic. For example, Dr Hahn coined the term hyperthermic sensitizer for those drugs that are not cytotoxic at 37 degrees C, but have observable cytotoxicity at elevated temperatures. A new class of hyperthermic sensitizers, azo-dihydrochlorides, decompose in aqueous media to release free radicals. Almost no cytotoxicity of these drugs is observed at 37 degrees C, but the drugs are exquisitely cytotoxic at temperatures of 41-42 degrees C. Identification of additional compounds with such properties is warranted, since systemic cytotoxicity could be avoided. Hahn also suggested that the increase in blood flow that occurs in tumours during heating could be exploited as a means to increase drug delivery. Use of this approach to enhance delivery of monoclonal antibodies has proven fruitful. Since long duration heating combined with low dose-rate irradiation leads to obliteration of the radiation dose-rate effect, this approach may be particularly advantageous with monoclonal antibodies radiolabelled with low LET isotopes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We previously found that nifedipine lowered pulmonary-artery pressure and improved exercise performance, gas exchange, and the radiographic manifestations of disease in patients with high-altitude pulmonary edema. We therefore hypothesized that the prophylactic administration of nifedipine would prevent its recurrence.METHODS: Twenty-one mountaineers (1 woman and 20 men) with a history of radiographically documented high-altitude pulmonary edema were randomly assigned to receive either 20 mg of a slow-release preparation of nifedipine (n = 10) or placebo (n = 11) every 8 hours while ascending rapidly (within 22 hours) from a low altitude to 4559 m and during the following three days at this altitude. Both the subjects and the investigators were blinded to the assigned treatment. The diagnosis of pulmonary edema was based on chest radiography. Pulmonary-artery pressure was measured by Doppler echocardiography and the difference between alveolar and arterial oxygen pressure was measured in simultaneously sampled arterial blood and end-expiratory air.RESULTS: Seven of the 11 subjects who received placebo but only 1 of the 10 subjects who received nifedipine had pulmonary edema at 4559 m (P = 0.01). As compared with the subjects who received placebo, those who received nifedipine had a significantly lower mean (+/- SD) systolic pulmonary-artery pressure (41 +/- 8 vs. 53 +/- 16 mm Hg, P = 0.01), alveolar-arterial pressure gradient (6.6 +/- 3.8 vs. 11.8 +/- 4.4 mm Hg, P less than 0.001), and symptom score of acute mountain sickness (2.0 +/- 0.7 vs. 3.9 +/- 1.9, P less than 0.01) at 4559 m.CONCLUSIONS: The prophylactic administration of nifedipine is effective in lowering pulmonary-artery pressure and preventing high-altitude pulmonary edema in susceptible subjects. These findings support the concept that high pulmonary-artery pressure has an important role in the development of high-altitude pulmonary edema.",

    "abstract": "For a solid tumor to become life-threatening, an adequate blood supply has to be established. Although neovascularization has dire consequences for the host, it furnishes a common route through which tumors may be accessed and eradicated by drugs. The fact that a tumor's vasculature is relatively more permeable than that of healthy host tissue means selective delivery of drugs may be achieved. The role played by the cells making up the tumor vascular bed, vascular endothelial cells (VECs), has to be evaluated closely in attempts to design ways for enhancing drug delivery to solid tumors via the vasculature. The two major roles of VECs in the body, as barrier and as transport, are both highly pertinent to drug delivery. Our review examines how VECs may be manipulated in vivo to improve the selective delivery of carriers for oligonucleotide constructs to solid tumors. It also discusses how oligonucleotide drugs may be targeted against tumor VECs on the premise that by killing these cells, the tumor itself will perish. Cationic liposomes and microspheres are the major delivery vehicles discussed, with added analyses of such other nucleic acid carriers as nanospheres, dendrimers, and polyethyleneimine.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: To investigate (1) aerosol lung deposition obtained from two small volume conventional spacers (Babyhaler and Aerochamber) and a home made spacer (modified 500 ml plastic cold drink bottle); (2) the effect of using a face mask or mouthpiece; and (3) the relation between age and pulmonary deposition.METHODS: Lung deposition of aerosolised technetium-99m DTPA inhaled via spacer was measured in 40 children aged 3-7 years with stable asthma. Each patient performed sequential randomly assigned inhalations using two spacers. Three studies were performed: Babyhaler compared to Aerochamber (with facemasks); Babyhaler with facemask compared to Babyhaler with mouthpiece; and Babyhaler with mouthpiece compared to a 500 ml bottle.RESULTS: Median lung aerosol deposition from a Babyhaler and Aerochamber with masks were similar (25% v 21%, p = 0.9). Aerosol lung deposition from a Babyhaler with mask compared to a Babyhaler with mouthpiece was equivalent (26% v 26%, p = 0.5). Lung deposition was higher from a 500 ml bottle compared to a Babyhaler in both young (25% v 12.5%, p = 0.005) and older children (42% v 22.5%, p = 0.003). A notable reduction in pulmonary deposition occurred at 50 months of age.CONCLUSION: A Babyhaler or Aerochamber produce equivalent lung deposition of aerosol. There is no difference in lung deposition when a mask or mouthpiece is used. A modified 500 ml plastic bottle produces greater pulmonary aerosol deposition than a conventional small volume spacer.",

    "abstract": "A novel peritoneal carrier solution, Icodextrin 20 (7.5%), has allowed exploration of prolonged, intraperitoneal (i.p.) infusion of the cytotoxic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). A phase I and pharmacokinetic study was performed to determine the toxicities and maximum tolerated dose of prolonged and continuous intraperitoneal 5-FU in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Seventeen patients were entered into this study. Each patient had a Tenckhoff catheter placed into the peritoneal cavity under general anaesthetic. After initial flushing and gradual increase in exchange volumes with Icodextrin 20, 5-FU was administered daily from Monday to Friday, 50% as a bolus in the exchange bag and 50% in an elastomeric infusor device delivering continuous 5-FU to the peritoneal cavity at 2 ml h-1. Treatment was continued for 12 weeks or until intolerable toxicity developed. Abdominal pain and infective peritonitis proved to be the main dose-limiting toxicities. Initial problems with infective peritonitis were overcome by redesign of the delivery system, and it proved possible to deliver 300 mg m-2 5-FU daily (5 days per week) for 12 weeks. Pharmacokinetic studies showed i.p. steady-state 5-FU concentrations (mean 47 500 ng ml-1) that were > 1000-fold higher than systemic venous levels (mean 30 ng ml-1).",

    "abstract": "Patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee were treated with chondroitin sulfate (CS, Condrosulf, IBSA, Lugano, CH) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, performed in two centres. The efficacy and tolerability of oral CS capsules 2 x 400 mg/day vs placebo was assessed in a 6-month study period. Patients with idiopathic or clinically symptomatic knee OA, with Kellgren and Lawrence radiological scores I-III, were included in this trial. Clinical controls were performed at months 0, 1, 3 and 6. Eighty patients completed the 6-month treatment period. Lequesne's Index and spontaneous joint pain (VAS) decreased constantly in the CS group; on the contrary, slight variations of the scores were reported in the placebo group. The walking time, defined as the minimum time to perform a 20-meter walk, showed a statistically significant constant reduction only in the CS group. ANOVA with repeated measures showed a statistically significant difference in favor of the CS group for these three parameters. During the study, patients belonging to the placebo group reported a higher paracetamol consumption, but this consumption was not statistically different between the two treatment groups. Efficacy judgements were significant in favor of the CS group. Both treatments were very well tolerated. All these results strongly suggest that chondroitin sulfate acts as a symptomatic slow-acting drug in knee OA.",

Mean diastolic blood pressure was lower during the day with felodipine than with nifedipine, at 77.6 (2.4) v 84.4 (2.8) mm Hg (p = 0.05). Similarly, blood pressure load (the percentage of the day during which the child had blood pressure exceeding the upper limits of normal for age) was lower for felodipine than for nifedipine: 43.5 (5.5)% v 61.3 (6.3)%. There was an opposite trend during the night, though this did not reach statistical significance. These data suggest that once a day felodipine is effective in children with hypertension.

    "abstract": "A congealable disperse phase encapsulation method was used to prepare controlled release lipid microspheres of sulphamethizole as a model drug. Hydrogenated cotton seed oil (HCSO) and stearic acid were employed as the lipid matrix materials. Tween 60 was the droplet stabilizer used to form microspheres. In in vitro dissolution tests, the drug release was found to be affected by the type of lipid material depending on hydrophilicity. Generally, an initial rapid release followed by a slower release of the drug from the lipid microspheres was observed. Lipid microspheres were also compressed in the tablet form to prevent the initial rapid release of the drug. But the drug release drastically decreased. To achieve a controlled release of the drug. Eudragit L as a channeling agent was added internally to HCSO-microspheres. Although the drug release increased, the controlled release pattern was not achieved. The external addition of polyethyleneglycole 4000 to HCSO-microspheres before compressing tablets, did not produce an affirmative change in the release profile. The lipid microspheres prepared by stearic acid released all of the drug within 1 h. Upon compression, the drug release was very low. Therefore, stearic acid-microspheres were compressed in the tablet form adding disintegrating agents, sodium alginate and Ac-Di-Sol (cross-linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose). A pH-dependent drug release was obtained from the tablets containing sodium alginate. With the tablets of stearic acid-microspheres containing Ac-Di-Sol, the controlled release could be achieved due to gradual disintegration from the tablet to aggregates, and to individual microspheres. Furthermore, in vivo study on 6 healthy volunteers confirmed the controlled release pattern of this dosage form.",

The preparations were an oral solution, two types of film-coated tablets and two types of enteric-coated tablets. Blood samples were drawn hourly from 8 am to 6 pm on the day before each study day to assess baseline serum iron concentrations and on the study day. Spectrophotometry was used to measure the serum iron concentrations. The area under the curve (AUC), the maximum concentration and the time to achieve the maximum concentration were compared by analysis of variance. The enteric-coated preparations resulted in AUCs less than 30% of the AUC for the oral solution. The two film-coated products produced AUCs essentially equivalent to that of the oral solution. We conclude that the bioavailability of iron in the enteric-coated preparations was low, relative to that of the film-coated products and the oral solution, and that these products should not be considered interchangeable.",

Eighteen pairs of exacerbations were available for analysis, during which subjects took an increased dose of inhaled steroids or continued on the same dose.RESULTS: There was no significant difference between increasing inhaled steroids or placebo on morning or evening peak expiratory flow rates (PEFRs), diurnal peak flow variability, or symptom scores in the two weeks following an asthma exacerbation. Difference (95% confidence intervals) in baseline PEFR on days 1-3 were 3.4% (-3.5% to 10.4%) and -0.9% (-4.7% to 2.9%) for inhaled steroid and placebo, respectively. Spirometric function and the parents' opinion of the effectiveness of asthma medications at each exacerbation were also not significantly different between inhaled steroid or placebo.CONCLUSION: This study suggests that increasing the dose of inhaled steroids at the onset of an exacerbation of asthma is ineffective and should not be included in asthma self management plans.",

    "abstract": "The analgesic efficacy of amitriptyline 25 mg was compared with placebo in 41 patients with chronic (more than 3 months) nonmalignant pain, using a double-blind randomised multiple-dose 3-week treatment period crossover design. Amitriptyline 25 mg provided significantly greater efficacy than placebo, with significant differences evident within the first week. There was no significant difference on mood scores between amitriptyline and placebo. The results suggest that surprisingly low doses of amitriptyline may be effective without substantial adverse effects, that the effect is evident early, and that the effect is distinguishable from any effect of the amitriptyline on mood.",

    "abstract": "In this randomized, double-blind study, we have compared the ability of 5% liposome-encapsulated tetracaine (amethocaine) (LET) vs 5% eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics (EMLA) to produce local anaesthesia of intact skin in 40 healthy volunteers. Volunteers had both preparations applied to their forearms under an occlusive dressing for 1 h. Superficial anaesthesia was measured by a total of nine 1-mm pinpricks on each arm. Deeper anaesthesia was assessed by single insertion of a sterile 22-gauge needle to a depth of 3 mm and pain was reported on a visual analogue scale (VAS). If the volunteer perceived greater than four of the 1-mm pinpricks, the 3-mm insertion was not performed. Results showed that the number of pinpricks perceived was significantly less (P < 0.01) for LET (median 1.0; range 0-9) vs EMLA (1.5; 0-9). In volunteers who had deeper anaesthesia assessed, there was no significant difference (P = 0.065) in VAS scores for LET (mean 1.5 (SD 1.4); n = 34) vs EMLA (2.4 (2.1); n = 28). Overall anaesthetic effect, as ranked by all of the subjects, was significantly better for LET compared with EMLA (P = 0.024). We have demonstrated that when applied in equal volumes, 5% LET produced better superficial local anaesthesia than EMLA.",

Introduction of novel pain technologies should also consider the ultimate recipients of the treatments, i.e., patients and family caregivers at home. This article reviews four frequently ignored issues in the integration of new pain treatments. These are 1) recognizing that pain is managed by patients and family caregivers at home; 2) acknowledging patient and family caregivers' knowledge and beliefs about pain; 3) recognizing cost considerations; and 4) identifying common ethical dilemmas in managing pain at home.

In 19 patients, pharmacology studies were conducted after the first (day 1) and seventh (day 15) doses. In contrast to the decline in tretinoin concentration seen within 3 to 4 days of administration of daily oral ATRA, there were no differences between the area under the curve (AUC) of tretinoin concentration versus time on day 1 and day 15 (P = .98, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Peak day 1 concentrations after 15 mg/m2 were higher than those reported after 45 mg/m2 oral ATRA. Six patients with relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) were treated. Three, each in first relapse and at least year from the last exposure to oral ATRA, achieved a complete response (CR). Disease recurred in two (one at 3 months despite maintenance L-ATRA and similarity in tretinoin AUC on days 1 and 85, and the other at 5 months, 2 months after discontinuation of L-ATRA) and the third was transplanted 1 month into CR. The three nonresponders were in at least a second relapse and failed to respond to oral ATRA before or immediately after receiving L-ATRA. Severe toxicity developed in three of eight patients treated at 175 mg/m2 (joint pains in two, skin in one). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be 140 mg/m2, at which dose grade 2 toxicity (primarily headache and skin) occurred in eight of eight patients, but grade 3 to 4 toxicity in none. Compared with oral ATRA, L-ATRA apparently results in greater exposure to tretinoin and for a longer time.",

J Bone Joint Surg Am. 2001;83-A Suppl 1(Pt 2):S160-1.BACKGROUND: The role of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in osseous repair has been demonstrated in numerous animal models. Recombinant human osteogenic protein-1 (rhOP-1 or BMP-7) has now been produced and was evaluated in a clinical trial conducted under a Food and Drug Administration approved Investigational Device Exemption to establish both the safety and efficacy of this BMP in the treatment of tibial nonunions. The study also compared the clinical and radiographic results with this osteogenic molecule and those achieved with fresh autogenous bone.MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two patients (with 124 tibial nonunions) were enrolled in a controlled, prospective, randomized, partially blinded, multi-center clinical trial between February, 1992, and August, 1996, and were followed at frequent intervals over 24 months. Each patient was treated by insertion of an intramedullary rod, accompanied by rhOP-1 in a type I collagen carrier or by fresh bone autograft. Assessment criteria included the severity of pain at the fracture site, the ability to walk with full weight-bearing, the need for surgical re-treatment of the nonunion during the course of this study, plain radiographic evaluation of healing, and physician satisfaction with the clinical course. In addition, adverse events were recorded, and sera were screened for antibodies to OP-1 and type-I collagen at each outpatient visit.RESULTS: At 9 months following the operative procedures (the primary end-point of this study), 81% of the OP-1-treated nonunions (n = 63) and 85% of those receiving autogenous bone (n = 61) were judged by clinical criteria to have been treated successfully (p = 0.524). By radiographic criteria, at this same time point, 75% of those in the OP-1-treated group and 84% of the autograft-treated patients had healed fractures (p = 0.218). These clinical results continued at similar levels of success throughout 2 years of observation, and there was no statistically significant difference in outcome between the two groups of patients at this point (p = 0.939). All patients experienced adverse events. Forty-four percent of patients in each treatment group had serious events, none of which were related to their bone grafts. More than 20% of patients treated with autografts had chronic donor site pain following the procedure.CONCLUSIONS: rhOP-1 (BMP-7), implanted with a type I collagen carrier, was a safe and effective treatment for tibial nonunions. This molecule provided clinical and radiographic results comparable with those achieved with bone autograft, without donor site morbidity.",

N Engl J Med. 1999 Oct 7;341(15):1157-8. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199910073411514.BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Use of nicotine-replacement therapies and the antidepressant bupropion helps people stop smoking. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of sustained-release bupropion (244 subjects), a nicotine patch (244 subjects), bupropion and a nicotine patch (245 subjects), and placebo (160 subjects) for smoking cessation. Smokers with clinical depression were excluded. Treatment consisted of nine weeks of bupropion (150 mg a day for the first three days, and then 150 mg twice daily) or placebo, as well as eight weeks of nicotine-patch therapy (21 mg per day during weeks 2 through 7, 14 mg per day during week 8, and 7 mg per day during week 9) or placebo. The target day for quitting smoking was usually day 8.RESULTS: The abstinence rates at 12 months were 15.6 percent in the placebo group, as compared with 16.4 percent in the nicotine-patch group, 30.3 percent in the bupropion group (P<0.001), and 35.5 percent in the group given bupropion and the nicotine patch (P<0.001). By week 7, subjects in the placebo group had gained an average of 2.1 kg, as compared with a gain of 1.6 kg in the nicotine-patch group, a gain of 1.7 kg in the bupropion group, and a gain of 1.1 kg in the combined-treatment group (P<0.05). Weight gain at seven weeks was significantly less in the combined-treatment group than in the bupropion group and the placebo group (P<0.05 for both comparisons). A total of 311 subjects (34.8 percent) discontinued one or both medications. Seventy-nine subjects stopped treatment because of adverse events: 6 in the placebo group (3.8 percent), 16 in the nicotine-patch group (6.6 percent), 29 in the bupropion group (11.9 percent), and 28 in the combined-treatment group (11.4 percent). The most common adverse events were insomnia and headache.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with sustained-release bupropion alone or in combination with a nicotine patch resulted in significantly higher long-term rates of smoking cessation than use of either the nicotine patch alone or placebo. Abstinence rates were higher with combination therapy than with bupropion alone, but the difference was not statistically significant.",

In the steady-state multiple-dose study, twelve epileptic patients received 1200 mg/day of the reference drug (300 mg 9 AM, 300 mg 3 PM, 600 mg 9 PM) and the test formulation (600 mg 9 AM, 600 mg 9 PM) with at least one week interval in cross-over manner. The AUC values of the test controlled release formulation were 91.7% (95% confidence interval: 78.4-100.4%) of the reference drug in the single-dose study and 98.2% (95% confidence interval: 86.2%-109.9%) in the steady-state study. The AUC's of the two formulations were not significantly different by ANOVA test. The Cmax and Tmax values of the test formulation were significantly different from the values of the reference in single-(Tmax: 158.4%, Cmax: 52.5% of the reference) and multiple-dose study (Tmax: 153.5% of the reference). The MRT values of the test formulation were also significantly greater (129.4% of the reference) in the single-dose study. Regarding the controlled-release characteristics of the test formulation, fluctuation index and percentage fluctuation of the twice a day dosage regimen of the test formulation were comparable with those of the thrice a day dosage regimen of the conventional tablet. Area deviation was even smaller in the test regimen of the controlled release formulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The present 2-phase randomized double-blind split face study was designed to compare the effect of a gel containing 3% 2-dimethylaminoethanol (deanol, DMAE) with the same formulation without DMAE.METHODS: In a first pilot study, sensorial assessments and measures of the skin distension under suction were performed in eight volunteers. In a second study conducted in 30 volunteers, shear wave propagation was measured.RESULTS: Large interindividual variations precluded any significant finding in the first study. The DMAE formulation showed, however, a significant effect characterized by increased shear wave velocity in the direction where the mechanical anisotropy of skin showed looseness.CONCLUSION: The DMAE formulation under investigation increased skin firmness.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inhaled corticosteroids have dose related systemic effects determined by oral (swallowed or oropharyngeal absorption) and lung bioavailability. A study was undertaken to evaluate the significance of oropharyngeal absorption for fluticasone propionate.METHODS: Sixteen healthy volunteers of mean age 29.3 years were studied using an open randomised, placebo controlled, four way crossover design. Treatments were: (a) fluticasone metered dose inhaler (pMDI) 250 microg, 8 puffs; (b) fluticasone pMDI 250 microg, 8 puffs + mouth rinsing/gargling (water); (c) fluticasone pMDI 250 microg, 8 puffs + mouth rinsing/gargling (charcoal); and (d) placebo pMDI, 8 puffs + mouth rinsing/gargling (water). Overnight (ONUC) and early morning (EMUC) urinary cortisol/creatinine ratios and 8 am serum cortisol (SC) levels were measured.RESULTS: Significant (p<0. 05) suppression of ONUC, EMUC, and SC occurred with each active treatment compared with placebo. The mean values (95% CI for difference from placebo) were: (a) ONUC (nmol/mmol): fluticasone (2. 8, 95% CI 3.6 to 7.9), fluticasone + water (3.1, 95% CI 3.3 to 7.7), fluticasone + charcoal (2.3, 95% CI 4.1 to 8.5); placebo (8.6); (b) EMUC (nmol/mmol): fluticasone (5.6, 95% CI 8.4 to 24.5), fluticasone + water (7.6, 95% CI 6.6 to 22.4); fluticasone + charcoal (5.6, 95% CI 8.7 to 24.5); placebo (22.1). There were no significant differences between active treatments. The numbers of subjects with an overnight urinary cortisol of <20 nmol/10 hours were 0 (placebo), 11 (fluticasone), 12 (fluticasone + water), and 13 (fluticasone + charcoal).CONCLUSIONS: Oropharyngeal absorption of fluticasone does not significantly contribute to its overall systemic bioactivity as assessed by sensitive measures of adrenal suppression. In view of almost complete hepatic first pass inactivation with fluticasone, there is no rationale to employ mouth rinsing to reduce its systemic effects although it may be of value for reducing oral candidiasis.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the possible benefits of intravenous isosorbide dinitrate in acute myocardial infarction and oral isosorbide mononitrate in subacute myocardial infarction.METHODS: 316 patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction were entered into double blind placebo controlled clinical trials assessing infarct size by enzyme release, ventricular size and function by echocardiography, reperfusion by continuous 12 lead ST segment monitoring and late potentials by high resolution electrocardiography.RESULTS: 301 patients, of whom 292 (97%) received thrombolytic treatment, were randomised on admission to intravenous isosorbide dinitrate or placebo. Overall, there was no significant effect of treatment on infarct size, ST segment resolution, ventricular remodelling, or late potentials at day 3. A trend was observed towards a reduction in infarct size in patients with non-Q wave infarction treated with isosorbide dinitrate. Heterogeneity of nitrate effect was observed in relation to the degree of ST segment elevation on presentation with a clear benefit of isosorbide dinitrate in patients with moderate ST segment elevation (472 U/l v 704 U/l, P = 0.003) and a trend towards a deleterious effect in patients with marked ST segment elevation (1152 U/l v 1058 U/l, P = 0.2). ST segment re-elevation was more common among patients receiving nitrate treatment than in those assigned to placebo (29 v 16, P < 0.05). Some 160 patients underwent a further randomisation to sustained release isosorbide mononitrate or placebo on day 3. Echocardiographic volumes after 6 weeks of treatment were similar in the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: No benefit was observed with administration of nitrates in the treatment groups as a whole for either acute or subacute infarction. There was, however, evidence of heterogeneity of effect in the different subgroups of acute infarction, and the possibility that nitrates may have differing actions in different groups of patients should be considered.",

    "title": "Reanalysis of carbamazepine and carbamazepine-epoxide pharmacokinetics after multiple dosing of extended release formulation.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To model and re-evaluate the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine (CBZ) and CBZ-10, 11-epoxide (CBZ-E) after 5 day b.i.d. dosing with either Carbatrol (extended-release beads) or Tegretol-XR (an osmotic pump tablet, an Oros tablet) using compartmental method.METHODS: Plasma concentration time profile data from 15 normal healthy adults received, in a randomized crossover fashion, Carbatrol (2 x 200 mg capsules), b.i.d. for 5 days and Tegretol-XR (400 mg), b.i.d. for 5 days were available for analysis from previous study. The compartmental kinetic parameters of CBZ and CBZ-E were simultaneously fitted by assuming: i) one compartment open model with zero order absorption with lag time, and first order elimination for CBZ and ii) one compartment open model with Michaelis-Menten formation with a sigmoidity factor, and first order elimination for CBZ-E. Time to 50% of CBZ plateau concentrations (TC50) was estimated and statistically compared between the two products.RESULTS: There was a good agreement between simulated and observed plasma concentrations. For CBZ, the fitted parameters were: the first order elimination rate constant (K(10)) 0.024 and 0.022 hr(-1), t(1/2) 27.3 and 30.3 hr, volume of central compartment (V(1) ) 1.119 and 1.160 L/kg, for Carbatrol and Tegretol-XR, respectively. For CBZ-E, the fitted parameters were: the first order elimination rate constant (K (30) ) 0.128 and 0.157 hr (-1), t (1/2) 6.1 and 5.1 hr, volume of central compartment (V (3) ) 0.728 and 0.644 L/kg, V (max) 0.085 and 0.076 mg/hr/kg, K (m) 28.639 and 33.138 mg/mL, for Carbatrol and Tegretol-XR, respectively. The fitted pharmacokinetic parameters of CBZ and CBZ-E were generally consistent with published values from previous studies. A minimal rise in CBZ-E concentrations was observed during the first 12 hours, the finding of which has not been reported before. Consequently, the CBZ-E plasma profiles appear as sigmoid curves and have a different shape compared to those of the CBZ profiles. The inclusion of the sigmoidity factor allowed flexibility in the fitting and optimized the simulation results. When compared to published literature of single dose data, the investigation of CBZ and CBZ-E pharmacokinetics from this study suggested that autoinduction might occur by the fifth day of dosing and might partly contribute to the sigmoidal shape of CBZ-E profiles.CONCLUSION: The fitted model well described the plasma profiles of both CBZ and CBZ-E. Carbatrol and Tegretol-XR were similar in their pharmacokinetics based on compartmental analysis.",

    "abstract": "Observations that serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels begin to rise after initial suppression during chronic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist treatment of men with prostate cancer had led to speculation that FSH escape might in part account for the failure of GnRH agonist analogs to completely suppress spermatogenesis in normal eugonadal men. However, previous studies in healthy young men failed to report FSH escape during GnRH agonist treatment for up to 16 weeks. We considered the possibility that this may have been due to the insensitivity of the FSH assays. Accordingly, using highly sensitive and specific two-site directed fluorometric assays and a sustained-release GnRH agonist formulation, we reexamined the issue of whether serum FSH levels rise after initial suppression during chronic GnRH agonist treatment. Two groups of healthy normal men, 19-50 years of age, received 7.5 mg of a long-acting GnRH agonist microcapsule formulation (Lupron Depot; TAP Pharmaceutical Company, North Chicago, Illinois) on days 1 and 30. In addition, the subjects received either 4 or 8 mg/day testosterone replacement by means of a testosterone microcapsule injected intramuscularly on day 1. Serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH levels were measured by sensitive and specific two-site directed fluorometric assays on multiple occasions during the 3-week control period and the 9-week treatment period. Serum LH levels declined to a nadir between 2 and 4 weeks and stayed suppressed throughout the remainder of the treatment period in both the 4- and 8-mg testosterone groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "title": "Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with non-prescription medications for the treatment of obesity.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) and benzocaine are non-prescription medications approved for treating obesity. The dose of PPA for weight loss is 75 mg/day. PPA has the same chemical similarity to pseudoephedrine that amphetamine has to methamphetamine. Because benzocaine causes weight loss by altering taste and PPA by central appetite suppression, they may induce additional weight loss when combined. These studies explore the safety and efficacy of low-dose PPA, pseudoephedrine, and PPA with benzocaine in causing weight loss.RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Study 1 compared PPA 12.5 mg tid with 25 mg tid and placebo in a 6-week trial in 108 obese subjects. Study 2 compared pseudoephedrine 120 mg/day and a placebo in a 12-week trial with 72 obese subjects. Study 3 compared 4 groups of 20 obese subjects using PPA 75 mg/day, benzocaine gum 96 mg/day, PPA with benzocaine gum, and a placebo over 12 weeks.RESULTS: Both doses of PPA gave twice the weight loss of placebo, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Pseudoephedrine was no different than placebo in inducing weight loss. The PPA with benzocaine group had more adverse events than the benzocaine group (p = 0.03), the placebo group (p = 0.03), or the PPA group (p = 0.09) without additional weight loss.DISCUSSION: We conclude that further studies with low-dose PPA for weight loss are indicated, that pseudoephedrine is not effective for weight loss, and that adding benzocaine to phenylpropanolamine increases adverse effects without increasing weight loss.",

    "title": "Effects on cancer patients' health-related quality of life after the start of morphine therapy.",
    "abstract": "To investigate the effects of morphine on cancer patients' health-related quality of life (HRQL), we prospectively studied 40 cancer patients with moderate or severe pain despite treatment with \"weak\" opioids. The patients were titrated to pain relief using immediate-release (IR) morphine and then switched to slow-release (SR) morphine in the same daily dosages. HRQL was measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core quality-of-life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) before the start of morphine (baseline), after stabilization with IR-morphine, and 3 days after start of SR-morphine. The mean titrated daily morphine dosage was 97 mg (range, 60-180). The EORTC QLQ-C30 global health score increased after IR morphine titration (baseline score 40, IR morphine period score 49), but a significant difference from baseline did not persist during the SR morphine period (score 44). The other functional HRQL scores showed no significant fluctuations. After start of IR morphine, two of the HRQL symptom scores increased, nausea/vomiting and constipation, but these changes also did not persist during the SR morphine period. Intensity of pain was associated with a lower level of function and higher intensity of symptoms, but only with relatively small (not higher than 0.44) correlation coefficients. Compared to normative data from the general population, physical function, role function, social function, and global health were impaired in the study patients. The patients also suffered more fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, appetite loss, and constipation. In conclusion, in cancer patients with reduced HRQL, the start of morphine therapy had no major influence on aspects of HRQL other than pain.",

    "title": "Aerosol recovery from large-volume reservoir delivery systems is highly dependent on the static properties of the reservoir.",
    "abstract": "In this study, the role of electrostatic fields on aerosol recovery from a system with a large collapsible reservoir (30 L) was investigated. In addition, the efficacy of the reservoir method for bronchial challenge procedures was assessed in vivo. Aerosol recovery was determined by measuring the fraction of aerosol (0.05% 99mTc-tagged human albumin solution) retrieved from the reservoir. Before aerosol recovery experiments, electrostatic fields in the reservoir were measured. Aerosol recovery varied significantly with wall thickness of the reservoir and presence of an antistatic coating (range 6.0-70.3%). A close inverse relationship was found between the mean electrostatic field in the reservoir and aerosol recovery. The nebulized provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second in asthmatics was found to be approximately half that of a standard method when compared with the reservoir system (mean ratio 2.24 (95% confidence interval, 1.60-3.12)). Recovery from an aerosol delivery system with a relatively large collapsible aerosol reservoir was highly dependent on the electrostatic field in the reservoir. In these systems the use of electrostatic field dissipative material for the reservoir is therefore recommended.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the efficacy of long-acting nifedipine as monotherapy in 52 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension in a randomized, controlled crossover study. Good blood pressure control was achieved in 34 of 40 patients (85%) receiving nifedipine (mean daily dose, 52 mg in 2 divided doses) compared with 23 of 40 patients (58%) receiving metoprolol (mean daily dose, 155 mg in 2 divided doses). After treatment for 4 weeks, the mean blood pressures with nifedipine (149.7 +/- 16.6/88.7 +/- 11.1 mm of mercury) and metoprolol administration (163.9 +/- 23.3/94.2 +/- 10.2 mm of mercury) were significantly lower than with placebo (176.7 +/- 17.3/100.9 +/- 7.1 mm of mercury) (P less than .05). The mean systolic pressure during nifedipine treatment was 14.2 mm of mercury lower (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9 to 24.5 mm of mercury) and mean diastolic pressure 5.5 mm of mercury (95% CI, 0.3 to 10.7 mm of mercury) lower than with metoprolol therapy. Both drugs were reasonably well tolerated, and intolerance requiring withdrawal was encountered in 3 of 45 (7%) patients receiving nifedipine, compared with 1 of 45 (2%) of those taking metoprolol and placebo, respectively. Adverse effects of nifedipine, most of which were transient, included palpitations, headache, facial flushing, and ankle edema. Long-acting nifedipine is a promising agent when given alone for mild to moderate hypertension and can be safely administered in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of the beta 1 selective adrenoceptor blocker atenolol, the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist nifedipine, and the combination of atenolol plus nifedipine on objective and subjective measures of walking performance and foot temperature in patients with intermittent claudication.DESIGN: Randomised controlled double blind four way crossover trial.SETTING: Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield.SUBJECTS: 49 patients (40 men) aged 39-70 with chronic stable intermittent claudication.INTERVENTIONS: Atenolol 50 mg twice daily; slow release nifedipine 20 mg twice daily; atenolol 50 mg plus slow release nifedipine 20 mg twice daily; placebo. Each treatment was given for four weeks with no washout interval between treatments.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Claudication and walking distances on treadmill; skin temperature of feet as measured by thermistor and probe; blood pressure before and after exercise; subjective assessments of walking difficulty and foot coldness with visual analogue scales.RESULTS: Atenolol did not significantly alter claudication distance (mean change -6%; 95% confidence interval 1% to -13%), walking distance (-2%; 4% to -8%), or foot temperature. Nifedipine did not alter claudication distance (-4%; 3% to -11%), walking distance (-4%; 3% to -10%), or foot temperature. Atenolol plus nifedipine did not alter claudication distance but significantly reduced walking distance (-9%; -3% to -15% (p less than 0.003)) and skin temperature of the more affected foot (-1.1 degrees C; 0 to -2.2 degrees C (p = 0.05)). These effects on walking distance and foot temperature seemed unrelated to blood pressure changes.CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of adverse or beneficial effects of atenolol or nifedipine, when given singly, on peripheral vascular disease. The combined treatment, however, affected walking ability and foot temperature adversely. This may have been due to beta blockade plus reduced vascular resistance, which might also explain the reported adverse effects of pindolol and labetalol on claudication.",

    "abstract": "To better understand how structural and functional bone properties contribute to the changes in bone biomechanical properties revealed by ultrasound critical angle reflectometry (UCR) analysis, we measured both UCR velocities and histomorphometric properties in bone biopsy specimens from 33 osteoporotic patients before and following intermittent slow-release sodium fluoride (SRNaF) and continuous calcium citrate administration. Mean skeletal fluoride exposure was 17 months, and mean skeletal fluoride content was 0.203 +/- 0.088 SD% bone ash. Intermittent SRNaF and continuous calcium citrate promoted significant increases in trabecular thickness (122 +/- 18 SD microm to 131 +/- 20, p = 0.020), mineral apposition rate (0.79 +/- 0.26 to 1.05 +/- 0.40 microm/day, p = 0.014), and a significant decline in eroded surface (3.9 +/- 1.6 to 2.8 +/- 1.4%, p = 0.002). There were also significant increases in node number (0.193 +/- 0.100 to 0.368 +/- 0.245, p < 0.01) and node-to-node strut length (0.076 +/- 0.087 to 0.191 +/- 0.173, p < 0.01) relative to total cancellous area. Cortical UCR velocity did not change but cancellous velocity significantly increased by 97 m/s following therapy (p = 0.0005). When compared against the significant changes in bone histomorphometry and connectivity, the sum of both cancellous and cortical ultrasound velocities was significantly correlated with node number/area (R2 = 0.305, p < 0.0001) and node-to-node strut length/area (R2 = 0.372, p < 0.0001) and to a lesser extent with mineral apposition rate (R2 = 0.106, p = 0.032). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that 40% of the variance in the sum of the UCR velocities can be accounted for by the variability in these histomorphometric and connectivity parameters. There were no significant correlations between the sum of cortical and cancellous ultrasound velocities and cancellous bone volume (R2 = 0.014, p = 0533), trabecular thickness (R2 = 0.012, p = 0.47), or bone mineral density (R2 = 0.003, p = 0.80). These observations indicate that velocity measurements with the UCR methodology show an improvement in bone elasticity associated, in part, with an improvement in the rate of bone mineralization and an improvement in bone quality at the structural level as shown by microarchitecture.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: A new capsule dosage form of carbamazepine (CBZ) has been developed, consisting of three different types of beads (immediate-release, extended-release, and enteric-release) that may be taken sprinkled on food or swallowed for easy administration. We compared the pharmacokinetics of the extended-release dosage form of CBZ (Carbatrol capsules) twice daily with the conventional immediate-release formulation of CBZ four times daily.METHODS: The randomized, double-blind, two-way, cross-over study was conducted at two sites, with a planned sample size of 24 adult patients with epilepsy. Each treatment was administered for 2 weeks. At the end of the 2-week period, blood samples were obtained hourly for a 24-h period.RESULTS: The 90% confidence intervals (CI) of the ratio of the means of the extended-release formulation twice daily to the immediate-release formulation four times daily were within the range of 0.80-1.25 for each of the pharmacokinetic parameters for CBZ and for the summation of CBZ and CBZ-epoxide (CBZ-E). There was no difference in the frequency of seizures between treatment (p = 0.103).CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that extended-release CBZ twice daily was bioequivalent to immediate-release CBZ four times daily, with regard to CBZ levels and summation of CBZ and CBZ-E levels, based on the pharmacokinetic parameters evaluated. Substituting one formulation for the other did not cause patients to have a significant change in seizure frequency.",

This allows samples to be spatially scanned in terms of both topography and thermal conductivity, whereby placing the probe on a specific region of a sample and heating, it is possible to perform localized thermal analysis experiments on those regions. In this minireview, the principles of the technique are outlined and the current uses within the polymer sciences described. Current pharmaceutical applications are then discussed; these include the identification of components in compressed tablets, the characterization of drug-loaded polylactic acid microspheres, the analysis of tablet coats, and the identification of amorphous and crystalline regions in semicrystalline samples. The current strengths and weaknesses of the technique are outlined, along with a discussion of the future directions in which the approach may be taken.Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmaceutical Association",

Proof of putative \"antisense effects,\" and other mechanistic studies, would be greatly facilitated by the ability to directly demonstrate hybridization between an antisense (AS) ODN and its mRNA target in vivo. In addition, evidence of AS activity by demonstrating reduced levels of RNA or protein or by showing cleaved target molecules would lend proof of the concept. In this article we discuss how AS ODN may be used to down-regulate target gene expression with an emphasis on those targets chosen for our investigations, and we summarize the methods employed for this type of study.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.",

Statistical analysis indicated that a concentration of 4% produced effective percutaneous local anaesthesia to pin-prick, together with an acceptable onset time of approximately 40 min. Increasing the concentration did not reduce the onset time further, although there was some increase in the duration of anaesthesia. Formulations A and B were hydrophilic, whereas C was an oil-in-water cream. Effective anaesthesia with formulation C required a higher drug concentration (12%), perhaps because of partitioning of the lipophilic anaesthetic into the lipid phase of the vehicle. The rate-limiting step was considered to be diffusion by the lipophilic anaesthetic through the stratum corneum, shown by onset of anaesthesia after removal of the formulation from the test site.",

    "title": "Variability of aerosol delivery via spacer devices in young asthmatic children in daily life.",
    "abstract": "Pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDI) are widely used together with spacers for the treatment of asthma in children. However, the variability of daily medication dose for pMDI/spacer combinations is not known. Electrostatic charge is a potential source of dose variability. Metal spacers have no static charge. This study assessed and compared within-subject variability of aerosol delivery of metal and plastic spacers. This was a randomized, crossover study in children with stable asthma aged 1-4 (group I, n=17) and 5-8 (group II, n=16) yrs. In both groups the amount of drug delivered to the mouth by a metal spacer (Nebuchamber) and one of two plastic (polycarbonate) spacers, i.e. Babyhaler in group I and Volumatic in group II was measured. The metal and plastic spacers were tested at home in a randomized order for 7 days each, using budesonide (200 microg b.i.d.). Aerosol was collected on a filter positioned between spacer and facemask or mouth. Budesonide on the filter was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography. The mean filter dose for each child (mean+/-SD) during the 7 days was expressed as a percentage of the nominal dose. Within-subject variability was expressed as coefficient of variation (CV). Mean filter dose in group I was 41.7+/-10.1% for Nebuchamber and 26.0+/-4.0% for Babyhaler (p<0.001). Mean filter dose in group II was 50.2+/-9.2% for Nebuchamber and 19.4+/-7.2% for Volumatic (p<0.001). Mean CV in group I was 34% for Nebuchamber and 37% for Babyhaler (p=0.44). Mean CV in group II was 23% for Nebuchamber and 34% for Volumatic (p=0.003). There was substantial within-subject dose variability in aerosol delivery in children using a pMDI/spacer at home. This variability was lower for the metal than for the plastic spacer in children 5-8 yrs of age. The dose delivered to the mouth was about two-fold higher for the metal than the plastic spacer independent of age.",

    "abstract": "Vaginal atrophy can be reversed for most women through systemic hormones. Those women who cannot take systemic hormones can get relief of symptoms with local estrogen therapy, which ideally should be locally effective without significant systemic absorption and without endometrial stimulation. An estradiol-releasing vaginal ring was therefore tested for efficacy, safety and patient acceptability in a 15-week open-label, randomized parallel group trial with blinded evaluations of the cytological response data. Conjugated estrogen vaginal cream was used as a reference control. The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate whether the two treatments were equivalent regarding improvement in urogenital atrophy, improvement in physicians's overall evaluation of product performance on urinary and/or vaginal changes, and improvement in patient's assessment of urinary and/or vaginal symptoms. A secondary objective was to assess frequency of endometrial overstimulation during estrogen replacement therapy, to be measured by a progestogen challenge test. The ring and cream treatment produced an equivalent effect on the vaginal mucosa, and equivalence was also found in physician's and patient's assessments of both vaginal and urinary symptomatology. Both treatments were equally effective in improving the vaginal pH toward levels normally seen in fertile women (< 5.0). With regard to endometrial stimulation, significantly more patients had bleedings at progestogen challenge test after 3 months of treatment with cream than with the ring. The ring, however, was given significantly better overall product acceptability ratings by the patients. It can therefore be seen as an equally effective, but significantly more acceptable, new administration form for treatment of urogenital disorders due to estrogen deficiency, with a more favourable safety profile than vaginal cream.",

    "abstract": "Developed over the past two decades, the antisense strategy has become a technology of recognised therapeutic potential, and many of the problems raised earlier in its application have been solved to varying extents. However, the adequate delivery of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to individual cells remains an important and inordinately difficult challenge. Synthetic polymers appeared on this scene in the middle 1980s, and there is a surprisingly large variety used or proposed so far as agents for delivery of oligodeoxynucleotides. After discussing the principles of antisense strategy, certain aspects of the ingestion of macromolecules by cells, and the present situation of delivery procedures, this article analyses in detail the attempts to use synthetic polymers as carrier matrices and or cell membrane permeabilisation agents for delivery of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Structural aspects of various polymers, as well as the results, promises and limitations of their use are critically evaluated.",

One hundred patients undergoing gynaecological or general surgery were studied. In 60 patients, anaesthesia was maintained by intravenous infusion of a propofol/alfentanil mixture. In 40, an isoflurane/nitrous oxide based technique was used. For each technique, patients were randomly allocated to receive either closed-loop or manually controlled administration of the relevant agents (propofol/alfentanil or isoflurane), with an intra-operative target bispectral index of 50 in all cases. Closed-loop and manually controlled administration of anaesthesia resulted in similar intra-operative conditions and initial recovery characteristics. During maintenance of anaesthesia, cardiovascular and electro-encephalographic variables did not differ between closed-loop and manual control groups and deviation of bispectral index from the target value was similar. Intra-operative concentrations of propofol, alfentanil and isoflurane were within normal clinical ranges. Episodes of light anaesthesia were more common in the closed-loop group for patients receiving propofol/alfentanil anaesthesia and in the manual group for patients receiving isoflurane/nitrous oxide anaesthesia. Convenience aside, the closed-loop system showed no clinical advantage over conventional, manually adjusted techniques of anaesthetic administration.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene. Recombinant adenoviruses have shown promise as vectors for transfer of CF transmembrane conductance regulator cDNA to airway epithelia and correction of the Cl- transport defect. However, because adenovirus-mediated gene transfer is transient, use of adenovirus as a vector for treatment of CF would require repeated administration. Therefore, we evaluated repeat administration of an adenovirus vector to the nasal epithelium of patients with CF with five escalating doses of up to 10(10) infectious units. There were no detectable adverse affects. All subjects were initially seropositive but developed additional humoral immune responses. The vector partially corrected the defect in airway epithelial Cl- transport in some subjects, although there was variability between subjects and there was less correction with subsequent administration, perhaps because the immune response limited gene transfer. Future work must focus on vectors with increased efficiency and with the ability to evade host defenses.",

This 3-month randomized, double-blind, multicentre study compared the efficacy and safety of azelaic acid 20% cream with its vehicle, in the treatment of papulo-pustular rosacea. A total of 116 patients were enrolled in the study and medication was applied twice daily. Azelaic acid cream produced significantly greater mean reductions in total inflammatory lesions than did vehicle (azelaic acid: 73.4%; vehicle: 50.6%; (p = 0.011), and erythema severity score (azelaic acid: 47.9%; vehicle: 37.9%; (p = 0.031). Azelaic acid cream treatment also resulted in significantly more favourable overall improvements than vehicle in both physician (p = 0.020) and patient ratings (p = 0.042). Neither azelaic acid cream nor vehicle produced any clinically relevant improvement in telangiectasia. Local adverse events were transient and mainly mild or moderate, and rates were similar for azelaic acid cream (39.5%) and vehicle (38.5%). Burning was the symptom most frequently reported. More than 90% of patients rated the overall local tolerability of their treatment as good or acceptable. In conclusion, azelaic acid 20% cream is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of papulo-pustular rosacea.",

    "title": "Two clinical trials of an intraocular steroid delivery system for cataract surgery.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine the safety and efficacy of an intraocular dexamethasone drug delivery system (Surodex) in the treatment of inflammation following cataract surgery.METHODS: Surodex is a biodegradable polymer that releases dexamethasone for 7 to 10 days after placement in the anterior segment. Study 1 was a prospective, randomized, double-masked Phase II clinical trial of 90 cataract surgical patients that compared treatment with Surodex to treatment with a placebo drug delivery system and to no anti-inflammatory drug treatment at all. Study 2 was a separate prospective, randomized, double-masked study of 60 cataract surgical patients that compared treatment with Surodex to topical dexamethasone (eye drop) therapy.RESULTS: In the first study, Surodex was superior to placebo in suppressing postsurgical inflammation throughout the 60-day postoperative period, as judged by masked-evaluator, slit-lamp grading of cell and flare. The differences were statistically significant from postoperative day 3 through postoperative week 3. The majority of Surodex patients did not require topical steroid by 2 weeks after surgery (93%) or by 2 months after surgery (88%). In the second study, Kowa laser flare meter readings were lower in Surodex patients throughout the 90-day postoperative period. The results were statistically significant at 4, 8, and 15 days following surgery. There were no significant adverse complications of Surodex in either study.CONCLUSION: Surodex was safe and effective in suppressing postcataract surgery inflammation and appears to be a promising alternative to topical steroids.",

To establish the role of the different components of the vehicle in the mechanism of dithranol irritation, the dithranol 3% cream used in the evaluation study and its vehicle with nine different combinations of its components were tested in a blind study. The creams were applied for 15, 30 and 45 min on the backs of 12 healthy volunteers. Irritation was scored as erythema by visual and colorimeter scoring. The dithranol creams with salicylic acid among their stabilizers showed 42% more irritation than the dithranol creams with only sorbic acid or no stabilizers at all. Stability tests showed no significant degradation of dithranol in the two less irritating creams when kept at 4 degrees C for 11 months. Salicylic acid in the cream aggravates dithranol-induced erythema.",

In all, 3,991 patients in NYHA class II-IV who were stable on standard medical treatment, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis, were randomized to metoprolol CR/XL or placebo and uptitrated from 12.5 or 25 mg to 200 mg over an 8-week period and were planned to be followed for a period of 2 years. The study was stopped earlier than planned due to the significant benefit achieved with metoprolol CR/XL on all-cause mortality. Treatment with metoprolol CR/XL was associated with a 34% decrease in all-cause mortality, 38% decrease in cardiovascular mortality, 41% decrease in sudden death, and 49% decrease in death due to progressive heart failure. The average dose of metoprolol CR/XL at the end of the study was 159 mg, and 64% of the patients were receiving 200 mg of metoprolol CR/XL.

In a double-blind placebo-controlled study in a specialist premenstrual syndrome clinic setting, 60 women aged between 20 and 45 years were randomized to one of three treatment groups: Group A (placebo implant four weekly + placebo tablets daily), Group B (goserelin 3.6 mg implant four weekly + estradiol valerate 2 mg daily with norethisterone 5 mg from days 21-28 of a 28-day cycle) or Group C (goserelin 3.6 mg implant four weekly + placebo tablets daily). Differences between PMS scores at 2, 4 and 6 months were compared with pretreatment values. There was a significant improvement in PMS scores in Group C (Zoladex + placebo) after 2, 4 and 6 months of treatment when compared to pretreatment values and Group A (placebo + placebo). The addition of a low-dose oral estrogen with a cyclical progestogen to GnRH analog treatment (Group B) resulted in a less dramatic response when compared to pretreatment values and no significant improvement when compared to Group A (placebo + placebo) at 2, 4 and 6 months of treatment. The addition of a low-dose oral estrogen with a cyclical progestogen to depot GnRH analog therapy in the treatment of PMS reduces the clinical response.",

    "abstract": "A percutaneous device system for long-term intracorporeal access is presented. A technical description of the device is given as well as results from healing in of device dummies and everyday functioning devices both in the short- and long-term perspectives in experimental animals and in human volunteers and patients. Major complications have not been observed by clinical inspection. Histological analyses of the animal experiments indicated that the downgrowth of the epidermal cells was arrested at the most superficial borderline of a preformed cavity region. An increased subepithelial cell density was observed lateral to a moderate sinus tract, but there were no heavy inflammatory cell infiltrations. The clinical success of the implants evaluated appears to be based on the following design factors: (1) selection of titanium as the tissue interfacing surface, (2) surface geometry factors applied, (3) a system of preformed cavities promoting connective-tissue interdigitation, (4) stress relief design of the subcutaneous flange, (5) high-precision surgical instrumentation and method. It is concluded that the results obtained so far are sufficiently promising to justify further controlled clinical trials and extended observation periods.",

    "title": "The dose-response relationship of controlled-release codeine (Codeine Contin) in chronic cancer pain.",
    "abstract": "The improved pain control provided by regular dosing of opioid analgesics in patients with severe cancer pain has been well established. However, the treatment of mild-to-moderate cancer pain is often limited to \"as needed\" dosing with fixed combinations of codeine or oxycodone plus a nonopioid analgesic, which do not allow optimal titration of the individual components. This randomized double-blind study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of controlled-release codeine (Codeine Contin) in patients with cancer pain, and to estimate its dose equivalence to a standard combination of acetaminophen plus codeine. Twenty-four patients with at least moderate cancer pain were randomized to Codeine Contin 100, 200, or 300 mg every 12 hr or acetaminophen plus codeine (600 mg/60 mg) every 6 hr. On days 1 and 4 of dosing, pain intensity and pain relief were assessed hourly for 12 hr. The sum of pain intensity differences (SPID) from baseline and the total pain relief (TOTPAR) scores demonstrated a dose-response relationship for Codeine Contin on days 1 and 4 that was statistically significant on day 1 and suggested greater analgesic efficacy on day 4, compared with day 1. Codeine Contin 150 mg every 12 hr was estimated to be equianalgesic to acetaminophen plus codeine (600 mg/60 mg) given every 6 hr. Because a similar equivalence was also demonstrated from analysis of adverse event data, it is concluded that Codeine Contin 150 mg produces analgesia and a side-effect profile similar to a 40% lower dose of codeine provided by the combination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We compared domiciliary therapy with terbutaline administered by the Turbuhaler and by a jet nebulizer. Forty nebulizer users with severe COPD were included in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. Terbutaline was inhaled t.i.d. for 2 weeks as dry powder (5 doses = 2.5 mg) by Turbuhaler or as solution (2 ml = 5 mg) by jet nebulizer (Pari Inhalierboy). The mean age of the 25 completing patients was 66 years (range: 54-81), the mean FEV1 was 0.73 l or 29% of predicted (range: 11-55%). The period where the Turbuhaler delivered the active drug was preferred by 16 patients, the nebulizer period by seven (P = 0.09). The median score concerning feeling of control over the disease--according to the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire--was better after the Turbuhaler period (P = 0.01). Other scores concerning disease related quality of life, the daily peak expiratory flow rates, the additional use of a metered dose inhaler were not significantly different for the two types of treatment. It is concluded that high dose domiciliary terbutaline treatment by Turbuhaler can replace nebulizer treatment in most patients with severe COPD.",

    "title": "Analgesic efficacy of sustained release paracetamol in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.",
    "abstract": "AIMS: Paracetamol is widely recommended as the initial treatment for pain associated with osteoarthritis (OA). A sustained release (SR) paracetamol formulation (Panadol Extend) was compared with standard immediate release (IR) paracetamol (Panadol) in patients with knee pain secondary to OA. The primary parameter for assessment of efficacy was patient-assessed global pain relief as determined on day 8 of the treatment period.METHODS: A double-blind, double-dummy, randomized study was conducted. Patients (n=403) were treated for 7 days with paracetamol 4 g day(-1) (SR paracetamol, two 665 mg tablets taken three times daily; IR paracetamol, two 500 mg tablets taken four times daily). Patients completed daily pain measurements and assessed global pain relief at the end of the study. Therapeutic noninferiority was defined on the basis of achieving statistical noninferiority for global pain relief.RESULTS: Analysis of the primary parameter for the intention to treat population showed that the difference in proportion of patients (SR-IR paracetamol) achieving a successful response on day 8 was -0.7%; 90% CI (-8.82%, 7.45%), P=0.890. For the per protocol population the difference in proportion was -3.0%; 90% CI (-11.61%, 5.66%), P=0.571. As the lower bound of the 90% CI for the treatment difference in each case was greater than the prespecified value (-15%), SR paracetamol was considered to be statistically noninferior to IR paracetamol in terms of pain relief. The treatments were not significantly different for any of the secondary parameters in either populations.CONCLUSIONS: SR paracetamol taken three times daily was statistically and therapeutically noninferior to IR paracetamol taken four times daily in patients with knee pain due to OA. SR paracetamol may be more convenient for patients with chronic pain and has the potential to enhance compliance and therefore pain relief.",

During the run in period the patients received 500 mg SRA once or twice daily as needed to control intraocular pressure (IOP). The dose was thereafter kept constant and patients were allocated randomly to 4 weeks treatment with CA followed by 4 weeks SRA or vice versa. IOP and venous plasma concentrations of acetazolamide were measured at weekly intervals. At the end of each 4 week course, patients were admitted for a 24 h profile of IOP and drug concentration measurements. 3. Thirty-five patients were recruited, but eleven were withdrawn during the run in period largely because of adverse effects; these became less troublesome when it was decided to give the once daily dose at 22.00 h. Four were withdrawn during the cross over, two because of inadequate IOP control. Twenty completed the trial. 4. The morning plasma concentration of acetazolamide measured each week showed no tendency to accumulation during the study. The mean swing (maximum minus minimum) in plasma acetazolamide concentration during the 24 h profile was less (P less than 0.005) with the SR formulation (11.6 +/- 4.9; mg l-1) +/- s.d.) than with the conventional (15.5 +/- 4.7) but the mean concentrations over the 24 h profile were indistinguishable (P greater than 0.05; 9.7 +/- 3.8 and 8.6 +/- 2.8 respectively). 5. Satisfactory control of IOP (no more than one reading above 22 mmHg) was maintained despite the changes in formulation in all but two of the patients who entered the cross over study. No close relationship between IOP and plasma concentration of acetazolamide was found. The 24 h IOP profiles whilst receiving each of the formulations were indistinguishable; thus the smoothing of the plasma drug concentration profile achieved by the SR formulation did not reduce the amplitude of swings in IOP. Similarly, no difference was observed between the formulations with respect to adverse effects. 6. It is concluded that the SR and conventional formulations were equivalent with respect to mean plasma acetazolamide concentration, IOP control and adverse effects. The SR formulation did not show practical advantages over the conventional formulation which was equally effective even with dosage intervals of 12 or 24 h.",

    "abstract": "We studied the clinical use of an automatic feedback control system to adjust the end-tidal anaesthetic concentration with a low-flow method. The end-tidal controller uses two input signals (the end-tidal and inspiratory concentrations) to control the isoflurane concentration in the fresh gas flow, using a model-based algorithm. We studied 22 ASA I-III patients during elective surgery lasting more than 2 h. The anaesthetist was asked to make four step changes of the target end-tidal concentration (+0.3, +0.6, -0.3, -0.6 vol%), either manually (Group A) or by setting the target value for the feedback controller (Group B), and then the control was changed and the step changes were repeated, in a crossover design. Eighty step changes with each control method were compared in terms of response time, maximal overshoot and stability. The automatic control system was more accurate and stable than the human controller for step increases and step decreases, with less overshoot/undershoot and greater stability [e.g. maximal overshoot 14.7 (SD 3.7)% and 18 (8.1)% respectively for +0.6 vol% step changes, and 19.8 (3.7)% and 30.7 (13.2)% respectively for +0.3 vol% step changes]. However, the automatic control system showed a faster response time than the manual method only with large increasing steps (e.g. 149 (32) s and 205 (57) s respectively for +0.6 vol% step changes) and was not different from manual control for decreasing steps. Automatic control of the end-tidal isoflurane concentration can be better than human control in a clinical setting, and this task could be done automatically.",

    "abstract": "The study objective was to compare the effect of budesonide administered as a nebulized suspension as compared to a spray with a spacer in adult asthmatics. In a double-blind, double-dummy crossover study, 26 adult patients with moderately severe unstable asthma were randomized to three 4-week treatment periods with budesonide 0.8 mg b.i.d. administered by a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) with spacer (Nebuhaler) and budesonide 1 mg and 4 mg b.i.d. administered by a Pari Inhalier Boy jet nebulizer. The nebulizer was activated only during inspiration. The total mass output was similar from the two devices but their fraction of small particles differed by a factor of 2 in favour of pMDI. Effect was evaluated from daily home measurements of peak expiratory flow (PEF), need of beta 2-agonist and symptom scores. Plasma cortisol and budesonide levels were measured in a subgroup of 10 patients. A consistent trend showed the nebulizer treatment to be at least as efficient as the pMDI plus spacer treatment. In actual fact, the apparent order of effect was: 4 mg nebulized suspension treatment > or = 1 mg nebulized suspension treatment > or = 0.8 mg pMDI with spacer treatment. Plasma budesonide and plasma cortisol also exhibited dose-related levels independent of device. The adverse effects reported appeared to be related to the dose rather than delivery device. Accordingly, the effect was related to total mass output, rather than to the small particle fraction of the budesonide aerosol. These results attest to the efficiency of jet-nebulized budesonide suspension, and indicate nebulized budesonide to be equipotent to standard budesonide therapy delivered by pMDI with Nebuhaler, provided nebulization is synchronized with inspiration and no loss of aerosol occurs during expiration.",

At least six herds were in a region and at least one herd/region contained fewer than 60 cows. Cows (n = 1213) were assigned randomly to control or bST groups and were treated beginning in wk 9 to 10 of lactation and every 14 d until dry-off or d 400 of lactation. Management was according to site practices. Cows were observed for health-related signs by farm personnel daily and by the herd veterinarian biweekly. Average 305-d test-day milk yields were 932 kg greater for bST-treated cows. Pregnancy rates, days open, twinning, cystic ovaries, or abortions were unaffected by treatments. Supplementation of cows with bST had no effect on total mastitis cases, total days of mastitis, duration of mastitis, or the odds ratio of a cow to develop mastitis. Cows supplemented with bST used more medications for health events other than mastitis. This usage was associated primarily with treatments for disorders of the foot and hock. Supplemented cows had a slight increase in foot disorders. There was no effect of supplementation with bST on culling from the herd or removal from study. Overall, the results confirm that label directions for bST are adequate for safe use under field conditions. All clinical signs observed in this study occur normally in dairy herds and were managed in cows supplemented with bST.",

    "title": "The influence of frusemide formulation on diuretic effect and efficiency.",
    "abstract": "AIMS: Changes in drug delivery rate may result in clinically important changes in drug effects. For the loop diuretic frusemide, it would be desirable to develop controlled release preparations, that could maintain an effective urinary excretion rate over a prolonged period of time. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of frusemide formulation on frusemide recovery, diuretic effect and efficiency.METHODS: Twelve subjects were given 60 mg of four different frusemide controlled release formulations in a single-dose, double-blind, randomized 4-way cross-over design. The formulations were three study drugs with different extended dissolution rates (ER1Tab, ER2Tab and ER3Caps ) and one reference drug (LR). Urinary volume and contents of frusemide in urine were measured in samples collected over 24 h.RESULTS: Substantial differences in frusemide recovery and diuretic efficiency were observed between LR and all other formulations. At 24 h, mean total frusemide recoveries of ER1Tab, ER2Tab and ER3Caps were 52%, 36% and 57% lower, respectively, compared with LR (P<0.01). Also at 24 h, mean total diuretic efficiency for ER1Tab, ER2Tab and ER3Caps was 83%, 31% and 135% higher, respectively, compared to LR. The rapid dissolution and absorption of LR resulted in a high diuretic response from 0 to 3 h after dosing. However, from 0 to 24 h, there were no differences in diuretic response between the formulations.CONCLUSIONS: Controlled release formulations of frusemide with a low and extended rate of dissolution lead to a more prolonged absorption and subsequent diuresis, but still maintain a similar cumulative response, due to their higher diuretic efficiency.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine whether antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) directed against the nuclear proto-oncogene c-myc could inhibit restenosis when given by local delivery immediately after coronary stent implantation.BACKGROUND: Failure of conventional pharmacologic therapies to reduce the incidence of coronary restenosis after percutaneous revascularization techniques has prompted interest in the use of agents that target intracellular central regulatory mechanisms.METHODS: Eighty-five patients were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg of phosphorothioate-modified 15-mer antisense ODN or saline vehicle by intracoronary local delivery after coronary stent implantation. The primary end point was percent neointimal volume obstruction measured by computerized analysis of electrocardiogram-gated intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) at six-month follow-up. Secondary end points included clinical outcome and quantitative coronary angiography analysis.RESULTS: Analysis of follow-up IVUS data was performed on 77 patients. In-stent volume obstruction was similar between groups (44 +/- 16% and 46 +/- 14%, placebo vs. ODN; p = 0.57; 95% confidence interval: -1.13 to 0.85). Minimum luminal diameter increased from 0.84 +/- 0.36 and 0.90 +/- 0.45 (p = 0.55) to 2.70 +/- 0.37 and 2.80 +/- 0.37 (p = 0.28) after stent implantation, which decreased to 1.50 +/- 0.61 and 1.50 +/- 0.53 (p = 0.98) by six months, yielding similar loss indexes (placebo vs. ODN, respectively). There were no differences in angiographic restenosis rates (38.5 and 34.2%; p = 0.81; placebo vs. ODN) or clinical outcome.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with 10 mg of phosphorothioate-modified ODN directed against c-myc does not reduce neointimal volume obstruction or the angiographic restenosis rate in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "This multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study was designed to investigate the hypothesis of equivalent efficacy and comparable safety of two inhaled presentations of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combination product (SALM/FP) 50/100 microg administered twice daily to patients with mild-to-moderate asthma for 12 weeks. The delivery systems were a 25/50 microg strength hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) metered-dose inhaler (MDI) and a Diskus inhaler (50/100 microg strength). A third group received FP 100 microg twice daily via a chlorofluorocarbon MDI (50 microg strength). A total of 497 patients aged 11-79 years with reversible airways obstruction who were symptomatic on inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy and had room for improvement in lung function were randomized to treatment in a double-blind, parallel-group design (SALM/FP MDI: n=165; SALM/FP Diskus: n=167; FP MDI: n=165) for 12 weeks. A total of 383 patients completed the study according to the protocol. According to the primary efficacy variable, increase in mean morning PEF over weeks 1-12, the two inhaled presentations of SALM/FP were clinically equivalent (adjusted mean increases 43 and 46 l min(-1); treatment difference 3 l min(-1); 95% confidence interval: -6 to 11 l min(-1)). Equivalence was also demonstrated by all secondary efficacy measures. The SALM/FP MDI was significantly superior to the FP MDI for increase in mean morning PEF (treatment difference 19 l min(-1); P<0.001) and for all secondary measures except FEV1 and symptom-free nights. There was no significant difference between the groups with respect to adverse events and serum cortisol levels. These results demonstrate that the SALM/FP 25/50 microg HFA MDI (two inhalations twice daily) is clinically equivalent to the SALM/FP 50/100 microg Diskus (one inhalation twice daily). Patients switching to SALM/FP from other MDI-based asthma treatments may now do so without a change of delivery device.",

    "title": "Two multi-center studies evaluating locally delivered doxycycline hyclate, placebo control, oral hygiene, and scaling and root planing in the treatment of periodontitis.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The clinical efficacy and safety of doxycycline hyclate (8.5% w/w) delivered subgingivally in a biodegradable polymer (DH) was compared to placebo control (VC), oral hygiene (OH), and scaling and root planing (SRP) in 2 multi-center studies.METHODS: Each study entered 411 patients who demonstrated moderate to severe periodontitis. Patients had 2 or more quadrants each with a minimum of 4 qualifying pockets > or =5 mm that bled on probing. At least 2 of the pockets were > or =7 mm. Treatment with DH, VC, OH, or SRP was provided at baseline and again at month 4. Clinical parameters were recorded monthly.RESULTS: DH and SRP resulted in nearly identical clinical changes over time in both studies. Mean 9 month clinical attachment level gain (ALG) was 0.8 mm for the DH group and 0.7 mm for the SRP group in Study 1, and 0.8 mm (DH) and 0.9 mm (SRP) in Study 2. Mean probing depth (PD) reduction was 1.1 mm for the DH group and 0.9 mm for the SRP group in Study 1 and 1.3 mm for both groups in Study 2. Frequency distributions showed an ALG > or =2 mm in 29% of DH sites versus 27% of SRP sites in Study 1 and 31% of DH sites versus 34% of SRP sites in Study 2. PD reductions > or =2 mm were seen in 32% of DH sites versus 31% of SRP sites in Study 1 and 41% of DH sites versus 43% of SRP sites in Study 2. Comparisons between DH, VC, and OH treatment groups showed DH treatment to be statistically superior to VC and OH. Safety data demonstrated a benign safety profile with use of the DH product.CONCLUSIONS: Results of this trial demonstrate that treatment of periodontitis with subgingivally delivered doxycycline in a biodegradable polymer is equally effective as scaling and root planing and superior in effect to placebo control and oral hygiene in reducing the clinical signs of adult periodontitis over a 9-month period. This represents positive changes resulting from the use of subgingivally applied doxycycline as scaling and root planing was not limited regarding time of the procedure or use of local anesthesia.",

    "abstract": "Forty patients were chosen at random to receive halothane or isoflurane anaesthesia during craniotomy and a comparison of the postoperative hypertensive response was made using a microcomputer-based closed-loop arterial pressure control system with sodium nitroprusside to control and assess arterial pressure during the first 6 postoperative hours. A desired target systolic pressure was chosen for each patient and the frequency of hypertension, sodium nitroprusside requirements and quality of arterial pressure control were compared between the two groups. Thirty-five patients required sodium nitroprusside. The halothane group required a median dose of 15.2 mg (range 0-72) compared to 3.4 mg (range 0-87) in the isoflurane group. This difference is not statistically significant. Quality of arterial pressure control was satisfactory in both groups. In conclusion, arterial hypertension occurs frequently following intracranial surgery and is uninfluenced by the choice of halothane or isoflurane intra-operatively. This closed-loop arterial pressure control system functioned safely and effectively in this context.",

The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of diltiazem (Dil, 90 mg, bid x 7 d, p.o.) were studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters in IRF patients (Ka 0.7 +/- 0.2 h-1, T 1/2e 3.7 +/- 0.7 h, Cmax1 45 +/- 4 ng.ml-1, Tmax1 3.1 +/- 0.4 h) did not differ from those in NRF patients (0.7 +/- 0.5 h-1, 4.1 +/- 1.3 h, 41 +/- 5 ng.ml-1 and 3.4 +/- 0.4 h, P > 0.05). Antihypertensive efficacy of Dil in patients with IRF was similar to that in those with NRF, and the hypotensive effect lasted over 24 h. The plasma Dil concentrations were strongly correlated with a decrease in BP in both groups. It was concluded that IRF did not affect the disposition of slow release Dil tablet under a steady state. No dosage adjustment of Dil is necessary in hypertensive patients with IRF.",

Assessment comprising auxology, pubertal staging, and pelvic ultrasound examination was carried out at weeks 0, 4, 8, 10, and 12 (first cycle) and weeks 8, 10, and 12 (second cycle) to evaluate the required injection frequency. Thereafter, assessment was performed on the day of injection. Zoladex LA was given every 12 weeks unless pubertal progression occurred.RESULTS: Satisfactory control was achieved in eight patients using this regimen, and three patients required more frequent injections. One girl was removed from the study because of clinical progression and extreme mood swings. No serious adverse effects occurred. Mean height velocity during the study period was 4.5 cm/year (range, 3.1-6.6) compared with 6.5 cm/year (range, 3.8-9.6) before treatment in nine patients for whom data were available.CONCLUSIONS: Zoladex LA was effective in controlling precocious puberty in girls when given at intervals of 9-12 weeks and it is recommended that an initial assessment is made eight weeks after beginning treatment.",

Patients were treated with 6 to 12 tablets or capsules of fixed-combination opioid/nonopioid analgesics per day at study entry. Patients received 30 mg of CR oxycodone tablets every 12 hr or 15 mg of IR oxycodone four times daily for 5 days. No titration or supplemental analgesic medications were permitted. The mean (+/- SE) baseline pain intensity (0 = none, 1 = slight, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) was 1.5 +/- 0.1 for the CR oxycodone-treated group and 1.3 +/- 0.1 for the group given IR oxycodone (P > 0.05). The 5-day mean pain intensity was 1.4 +/- 0.1 and 1.1 +/- 0.1 for the CR and IR groups, respectively (P > 0.05). Discontinuation rates were equivalent (33%). There was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidence of adverse events. This study demonstrates that cancer pain patients given 6 to 12 tablets or capsules of fixed-dose combination analgesics can be equally well treated with CR oxycodone administered every 12 hr or IR oxycodone four times daily at the same total daily dose. CR oxycodone offers the benefits of twice daily dosing.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed primarily to assess the safety and tolerability of fluticasone propionate (FP) 1 mg day-1 by comparison with beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) 2 mg day-1 over a 12-month study period. Lung function data were also recorded and used to determine whether the potency ratio between the two inhaled corticosteroids observed in previous studies was maintained in the long-term. Two hundred and thirteen patients with an established clinical history of severe chronic asthma and who were currently receiving between 1000 micrograms and 2000 micrograms day-1 of inhaled steroids were randomized to treatment in a ratio of 3:1 for FP:BDP (159 patients FP; 54 patients BDP), both via metered dose inhalers. Both treatments were well tolerated with a similar adverse event profile. No unexpected adverse events were recorded. Most adverse events were related to the patients' asthma, an intercurrent infection or underlying atopy. The incidence of pharmacologically predictable adverse events was equally low in both treatment groups as was the incidence of events suggestive of systemic steroid effect. Mean serum cortisol levels remained within the normal range at all visits for both treatments. At 12 months, however, the mean cortisol levels for the FP group had risen 4% above the baseline value but had dropped 15% below for the BDP group, giving a ratio of FP:BDP of 1.22; P = 0.01; 95% confidence limits (CL) 1.05-1.43. Fluticasone propionate 1 mg day-1 was at least as effective as BDP 2 mg day-1 in improving lung function (PEF, FEV1 and FVC) over this period. Moreover, the difference in FEV1 values at 6 months was significantly greater for the FP group than for the BDP group (P = 0.04; difference = 0.12 1; 95% CL = 0.01, 0.24 1). The difference between treatments in the amount of FEV1 reversibility was also significantly greater for FP at 12 months (difference in treatments = -3%; 95% CL = - 7-0%; P = 0.044). This study supports previous studies and suggests that FP is likely to be of benefit in the long-term treatment of chronic severe asthma.",

    "abstract": "Comment in    Thorax. 1998 Jan;53(1):77. doi: 10.1136/thx.53.1.77a.BACKGROUND: In a previous single dosing study in asthmatic school children fluticasone propionate produced significantly greater suppression of overnight urinary cortisol excretion than budesonide at high doses of 800 micrograms/day or greater. The aim of this study was to assess whether conventional lower doses of both drugs cause adrenal suppression when given at steady state twice daily by large volume spacer on a microgram equivalent basis in asthmatic school children.METHODS: Eight school children of mean age 12.1 years with stable asthma of mild to moderate severity (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 78.6% predicted, mid forced expiratory flow rate (FEF25-75) 72.5% predicted), on 400 micrograms/day or less of inhaled corticosteroid, were studied in a single blind (investigator blind), placebo controlled, crossover design comparing inhaled budesonide and fluticasone propionate 100 micrograms bid and 200 micrograms bid. Each dose was given at 08.00 hours and 20.00 hours for four days by metered dose inhaler via their respective large volume spacers with mouth rinsing. Measurements were made of overnight urinary cortisol and creatinine excretion after the eighth dose.RESULTS: Neither drug produced significant suppression of overnight urinary cortisol or cortisol/creatinine excretion compared with pooled placebo and there were no differences between the drugs. Only one subject with each drug at 200 micrograms twice daily had abnormally low urinary cortisol excretion of < 10 nmol/12 hours. Ratios for the fold difference between active treatment versus placebo for urinary cortisol excretion were (as means and 95% confidence intervals for difference): budesonide 100 micrograms b.i.d 1.03 (95% CI 0.46 to 1.61), budesonide 200 micrograms b.i.d 1.04 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.46); fluticasone 100 micrograms b.i.d 1.11 (0.45 to 1.77), fluticasone 200 micrograms b.i.d 1.12 (0.78 to 1.47). Likewise, there were no significant differences in overnight urinary cortisol/creatinine excretion.CONCLUSIONS: With repeated twice daily administration at steady state across a dose range of 200-400 micrograms/day no evidence of significant adrenal suppression was found using the sensitive marker of overnight urinary cortisol excretion for either fluticasone propionate or budesonide given via a large volume spacer. These results emphasise the good safety profile in children of these inhaled steroids at conventional dose levels, which have proven antiasthmatic efficacy.",

Eighty-six patients with a mean age of 38 years and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 37% of predicted normal value were randomized at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok to either Turbuhaler (50 micrograms dose -1) or pMDI (100 micrograms dose -1) with spacer (Volumatic). Doses of 100 + 300 + 300 + 300 micrograms salbutamol were given at 0, 15, 30 and 45 min via Turbuhaler and repeated at 90, 105, 120 and 135 min (total dose 2000 micrograms). The same inhalation schedule with identical number of doses was used for the pMDI with spacer but in double doses (total 4000 micrograms), assuming a dose-potency ratio of salbutamol administered via Turbuhaler compared with the pMDI of 2:1. At 85 min after the first dose, 60 mg prednisolone was given orally. FEV1 was measured 10 min after each dosing. Peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through Turbuhaler was measured on each dosing occasion. Plasma (P)-salbutamol, serum (S)-potassium concentrations, pulse rate, blood pressure and adverse events were recorded. No statistically significant differences were observed in the increase in FEV1 between the groups: 55 min (165 min) after the first dose, the increase was 0.47 l and 47% (0.64 l and 63%) in the Turbuhaler group, and 0.46 l and 42% (0.68 l and 65%) in the pMDI group. Mean PIF though Turbuhaler was 49 l min -1 (range 26-68) at first inhalation and increased to 60 l min -1 (range 38-86). There was no correlation between the initial PIF through Turbuhaler and the initial FEV1 response. P-salbutamol and S-potassium values correlated well. A larger decrease in S-potassium was noticed after 75 min in the pMDI group (0.38 mmol l -1) compared with the Turbuhaler group (0.23 mmol l -1) (P = 0.02). In conclusion, the use of a dry powder inhaler, Turbuhaler, was investigated in the emergency room treatment of acute asthma, and was as effective as a pMDI with spacer. Half the dose of salbutamol administered via Turbuhaler was as effective as the full dose given via a pMDI with spacer.",

    "abstract": "This multicenter, open-label, single crossover study examined 195 patients taking an immediate-release diltiazem tablet as chronic stable angina therapy to determine if apparently logical methods of converting them to an extended-release, once-daily formulation were effective. Patients were converted from the immediate-release (Phase I) to an extended-release (Phase II) formulation of diltiazem on a mg-for-mg basis or, when a similar dose was not available, to the next higher 120 mg dose. Weekly angina occurrences and nitroglycerin use, exercise testing at the end of each phase, and ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (AEM) during the week prior to the exercise study were evaluated. There was a statistically significant decrease in angina frequency and nitroglycerin consumption during Phase II. In the exercise studies, there was an insignificant increase in time to 1 mm ST-segment depression and total exercise time associated with a statistically significantly lower end-exercise blood pressure and heart rate in Phase II. In those patients who had ischemia during either phase on AEM, total ischemic duration and ischemic episodes were insignificantly lower in Phase II. All observations were similar in the subgroup of patients who were converted mg-for-mg. Adverse reactions were equal. Thus, in converting patients from an immediate- to an extended-release diltiazem formulation for the treatment of symptomatic coronary artery disease, it is reasonable to convert directly to the same or, if not available, the next higher available dose of the extended-release preparation.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies in dogs have suggested that the disposition of S- and R-propranolol may depend on the input rate of drug delivered to the liver. Therefore, this study was designed to determine whether differences in the disposition of S- and R-propranolol occur in humans when altering the input rate of propranolol by giving different dosage forms of the drug. Twelve healthy subjects were enrolled in a single-dose, 4-way crossover pharmacokinetic study in which racemic propranolol was given according to 1 of 4 treatments: one 80-mg immediate-release (IR) tablet, phase A; two 80-mg IR tablets, phase B; a 160-mg controlled-release capsule, phase C; or a 10-mg IV bolus, phase D. The results showed no significant differences in the ratios of S/R-propranolol for AUC, clearance, or overall mean concentration among the oral dosage groups. Significant differences in these parameters including Cmax S/R ratio were seen between the oral phases and the IV phase. These differences appear to be related more to the route of administration than to the low input rate. However, at high concentrations there may be input-rate alteration in S/R ratios. Specifically, for phase B, which had the highest Cmax concentrations, the Cmax S/R ratio was significantly lower than the other oral dosage groups A and C (Cmax S/R ratios: 1.44 versus 1.54 and 1.54, respectively; P < .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The objective of this open-label, repeated-dose, single-treatment, multicenter study was to evaluate the outcomes associated with a standardized conversion from prior opioid therapy to a novel, once-daily, OROS osmotic technology, extended-release (ER) hydromorphone formulation in an outpatient population with chronic malignant or nonmalignant pain. The study period was divided into 3 phases: the prior opioid stabilization phase (> or =3 days), the conversion and titration phase (3-21 days), and the maintenance phase (14 days). Patients were evaluated at 5 visits during the study period. Analgesic efficacy was measured using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). At baseline, patients were required to have daily oral morphine equivalent requirements of > or =45 mg. Prior oral or transdermal opioid therapy was converted to single daily doses of ER hydromorphone (8, 16, 32, and 64 mg tablets) at a 5:1 (morphine equivalent to hydromorphone) ratio. Immediate-release (IR) hydromorphone was given as rescue medication for breakthrough pain. Among the 445 patients who enrolled, 404 received the study medication. Of these, 73 (18.1%) had chronic malignant pain and 331 (81.9%) had chronic nonmalignant pain. Dose stabilization (defined as a 3-day period during which the total daily dose of ER hydromorphone remained unchanged and < or =3 doses of IR hydromorphone per day were required) was attained by 73.8% of patients (298/404), of whom 70.1% (209/298) were stabilized with < or =2 titration steps. The mean +/- standard deviation (SD) time to dose stabilization was 12.1 +/- 5.7 days (range of 3 to 33 days). The mean +/- SD final daily dose of ER hydromorphone was 63.4 +/- 129.2 mg. The mean +/- SD final daily dose of IR hydromorphone was 11.5 +/- 36.4 mg, and the mean +/- SD final number of daily doses of IR hydromorphone was 1.7 +/- 1.3. Intent-to-treat and completer analysis demonstrated significant improvements in BPI ratings from prior opioid therapy to the end of ER hydromorphone therapy (P < 0.01 for all pairwise comparisons). Adverse events were consistent with those expected of an opioid agonist in such a patient group, affecting primarily the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems. This uncontrolled study delineates a regimen by which patients with chronic malignant or nonmalignant pain can be readily converted from prior opioid therapy and titrated to an appropriate maintenance dose of ER hydromorphone. Controlled longitudinal studies are required to further evaluate the use of ER hydromorphone in patients with discrete chronic malignant or nonmalignant pain conditions.",

Pain, mood, and cognitive function were measured before and after achieving stable doses. In addition to reducing pain, long-acting opioid medication reduced anxiety and hostility. No declines in cognitive function were associated with the long-acting opioid medications, and the group receiving long-acting opioid medications showed significant improvement on a measure of psychomotor speed and sustained attention. Both patient groups reported significant reductions in perceived impairment in daily activities due to pain. Treatment responders taking long-acting opioid medications (63%) were taking a significantly lower dose at follow-up than the treatment non-responder group. These findings suggest that long-acting opioid medications can improve mood and do not impair cognitive functioning in patients with chronic non-cancer pain.",

    "abstract": "The Spacehaler is a new, compact, pressurized aerosol device that uses the same canister as a conventional metered-dose inhaler (MDI). Its design, however, reduces the velocity of the aerosol cloud that emerges from the inhaler, thereby reducing the amount of the non-respirable fraction of the drug delivered to the patient. Large volume spacers achieve a similar effect, but they are bulky and therefore inconvenient to use and carry around. This study compared the bronchodilator effect of 200 micrograms salbutamol delivered by the Spacehaler to that of an MDI used with a Volumatic spacer (MDI plus spacer) in patients with reversible obstructive airways disease. Twenty-five patients with asthma, having a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) between 50 and 90% predicted and a reversibility of > or = 15% to 200 micrograms salbutamol given by the conventional (standard) MDI entered the study. On two separate study days, they inhaled 200 micrograms salbutamol either via the Spacehaler or the MDI plus spacer. To maintain blinding, they received placebo on both study days via the alternate device. Their FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were measured before and at regular intervals for 6 h after inhalation. Assessment of equivalence between the two devices was based on whether the 90% confidence interval for the difference between the weighted mean FEV1 was within +/- 0.25 1. Patient preference was assessed by a questionnaire at the end of the second study day. Twenty-four patients completed the study. Both devices produced a significant improvement in FEV1 (P < 0.02). The upper and lower 90% confidence limits for the difference in weighted mean FEV1 between the devices was +/- 0.041, and the 99% confidence limits were +0.061 and -0.071. The weighted means for FVC and PEF, and the duration of effect and peak responses for FEV1, FVC and PEF also showed no difference between the two devices. Patients found no difficulty in using the Spacehaler, and 20 out of 24 patients (83.3%) preferred it to the MDI plus spacer. The bronchodilator effect of 200 micrograms salbutamol administered by a Spacehaler was equivalent to that produced by an MDI plus spacer in this group of patients with reversible airways obstruction. The majority of patients preferred it to a large volume spacer.",

    "title": "Evening vs morning isradipine sustained release in essential hypertension: a double-blind study with 24 h ambulatory monitoring.",
    "abstract": "A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study evaluated the effects on 24 h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) of isradipine sustained release (I-SRO) administered once daily, in the morning (AM) or in the evening (PM). Eighteen uncomplicated essential hypertensives (10 men, mean age 55 +/- 6 years) with casual sitting DBP 96-110 mm Hg received, according to a triple-way crossover design, I-SRO 5 mg AM, or 5 mg PM, or placebo for 4 weeks. A 24 h ABP monitoring (Spacelabs 90207) was carried out at the end of each treatment. Twenty-four hour BP was 145.3/89.8 mm Hg after randomized placebo. AM and PM I-SRO significantly reduced 24 h BP, by 13.7/8.7 and 12.9/8.2 mm Hg respectively. Daytime (07.00 h-23.00 h) BP significantly decreased by 15.0/9.7 mm Hg with AM and 13.2/8.7 mm Hg with PM regimen; night-time BP (23.00 h-07.00 h) significantly decreased by 11.6/7.1 and 12.3/7.4 mm Hg, respectively. Nocturnal nadir BP values were 132.6/78.1 after randomized placebo, 120.9/71.4 after AM I-SRO and 121.0/72.4 mm Hg after PM I-SRO. Morning peak BP values were 154.6/96.9, 139.5/87.6 and 137.5/85.5 mm Hg, respectively. Mean BP values in the early morning hours (i.e. between 03.00 h and 08.00 h) were significantly decreased by 12.1/7.3 mm Hg after AM and 14.3/7.9 mm Hg after PM intake. No significant differences were detected in the BP lowering effect of the two I-SRO regimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "title": "Metered dose inhaler and nebuliser in acute asthma.",
    "abstract": "One hundred and eleven children with acute asthma were studied to compare delivery of terbutaline by either a metered dose inhaler (MDI) with a valved holding chamber or a nebuliser driven by air. Eligible patients were randomised; the MDI group received three puffs (0.75 mg) of terbutaline and the nebuliser group received 2 ml (5.0 mg) terbutaline solution diluted with 2 ml 0.9% saline for inhalation over 10 minutes. Patients were evaluated by spirometry, pulse oximetry, and clinical severity scoring system at baseline and again 15 minutes after the beginning of treatment. The baseline data of the two groups were not significantly different. All parameters of spirometry, except the peak expiratory flow (PEF) for the nebuliser group, and clinical severity score for both groups significantly improved after terbutaline treatment. Compared with the nebuliser group, the MDI group after treatment had better mean (SD) oxygen saturation (SaO2; 96.82 (1.63)% v 95.44 (1.88)%), frequency of oxygen desaturation (23.2% v 47.3%), absolute increase of PEF (32.6 (37.7) l/min v 10.2 (34.7) l/min), and SaO2 (0.54 (1.64)% v -0.47 (1.84)%). There was also a mean (SD) per cent increase of forced expiratory volume in one second (22.9 (21.0)% v 15.4 (16.1)%), PEF (27.7 (38.4)%) v 7.7 (25.1)%), and SaO2 (0.58 (1.72)% v -0.47 (1.93)%). In conclusion, aerosol treatment by MDI (with a valved holding chamber) in this study proved to be superior to nebuliser treatment in terms of SaO2 and some measurements of spirometry. Respiratory therapists working with children with severe asthma should be aware of the possibility of oxygen desaturation, especially when using room air as the driving gas for nebulisation.",

Prior exposure to an anthracycline or anthracenedione was allowed. Liposomal daunorubicin at a dose of 100 mg/m2 was given intravenously over a minimum of 120 minutes every 3 weeks. as a single agent.RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were accrued: twenty-three (70%) had low-grade histologies; six (18%) had intermediate-grade histologies (follicular large-cell and diffuse small cleaved); and four (12%) patients had mantle-cell lymphoma. Eighteen (55%) had received two or more prior regimens; fourteen (42%) received a prior anthracycline. A median of six cycles of liposomal daunorubicin were administered (range 1-15). Of 31 patients evaluable for response, 2 complete and 10 partial remissions were documented for a major response rate of 39% (95% confidence interval (CI): 22%-58%). The median duration of response was 19.5 months (range 4.3-41.1+). Six responders (50%) had received a prior anthracycline; one responder had mantle-cell histology. The major toxicities were grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in 26 patients (79%), mild to moderate nausea in 22 (67%), and fatigue in 16 (48%).CONCLUSIONS: Liposomal daunorubicin at 100 mg/m2 every three weeks has activity in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL, including patients with prior exposure to an anthracycline. Further studies of liposomal daunorubicin in combination with other agents are warranted.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine compliance with the contraceptive patch (Ortho Evra/Evra) overall and by age among women in North America and to compare rates of perfect use with those of an established oral contraceptive.DESIGN: Data were pooled for three contraceptive studies in which women participated for up to 13 cycles; the subset of centers in North America was used in this analysis.SETTING: 76 North American centers.PATIENT(S): Healthy women 18-45 years of age.INTERVENTION(S): In all studies, the patch regimen was three consecutive 7-day patches (21 days) followed by 1 patch-free week per cycle.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Perfect use for the patch or oral contraceptive, defined as 21 consecutive days of drug-taking followed by a 7-day drug-free period; for contraceptive patch users, no patch could be worn for more than 7 days. Oral contraceptives were used according to package labeling.RESULTS: For all contraceptive patch users in North America (n = 1,785), perfect use was consistent across age groups. The percentage of cycles with perfect use of the patch ranged within age groups from 88.1% to 91.0%. In the comparative study conducted only in North America, perfect use was also consistent across age groups for the patch (n = 812), but rates of perfect use for the oral contraceptive (n = 605) differed significantly by age.CONCLUSION(S): Age did not affect compliance with the patch among all North American women studied. In a comparative study of women at North American centers, compliance with the weekly contraceptive patch was significantly better than with an established oral contraceptive. The contraceptive patch is uniformly easy to use across all ages.",

The reduction in degree of pain in the afternoon and in the evening was significantly higher (p < 0.01) for the morning dose. The total frequency and degree of gastrointestinal discomfort increased significantly (p < 0.01) during both treatment periods. The increases were mainly caused by increased gastric pain and constipation. No significant differences were found between the two regimes regarding tolerability.CONCLUSION: Ketoprofen controlled release given once daily in the morning compared to the evening to patients with osteoarthrosis may increase the efficacy without reducing the tolerability of the drug.",

    "title": "The effect of different concentrations of lactose powder on the airway function of adult asthmatics.",
    "abstract": "Lactose is widely used as a carrier of drugs in inhalation devices for asthmatic patients, but some clinicans have suspected that it may cause bronchoconstriction. Only a few studies have been done to examine this and the results are not uniform. This study was conducted to determine the effects of inhalation grade lactose delivered by Diskhaler on lung function and airway conductance in asthmatic subjects. The effect of five doses of lactose ranging from 6.25 mg to 100 mg and placebo were investigated using spirometry and constant volume plethysmography. Nineteen subjects (nine females) with stable asthma and a proven reversibility of at least 12% in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV) (compared to baseline) in the last 6 months, were included in this single-centre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study. The subjects received placebo plus five doses of lactose on one study day and six doses of placebo on another study day. Both doses and study days were assigned in a random order, and intervals of 1 h were allowed between each dose and at least 36 h between study days. Specific airways conductance (sGaw) and FEV were measured periodically over the course of 1 h after each dose of lactose or placebo. Administration of lactose at four or eight times the concentration in the Diskus and Diskhaler dry powder inhalers did not result in any statistically significant changes in FEV1. sGaw also showed no statistical difference between lactose and placebo at 1 or 3 min post-dosing. Both placebo and lactose produced both dilatation and constriction of the airways in the same patients, with no consistency in direction and no dose-response relationship. No adverse effect of lactose on a rways conductance or FEV1 of stable asthmatic patients was found in this study when given at higher than normal clinical doses.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The systemic effects of the inhaled corticosteroid beclomethasone dipropionate are reduced if the drug is inhaled through a large volume spacer. Use of spacers may therefore permit higher doses to be given without causing hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal suppression.METHODS: Randomised, double blind, double dummy, parallel group study was carried out in adults with chronic asthma to determine the dose of beclomethasone dipropionate causing hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal suppression when the drug was administered by metered dose aerosol with and without a large volume spacer. After a four week run in taking 1.5 mg beclomethasone daily 50 patients underwent tests of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal function (measurement of 0900 h serum cortisol concentration and 24 hour urinary free cortisol excretion and the short tetracosactrin test). Six patients had hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal suppression (results of at least two tests subnormal) and asthma was well controlled in six others. Thirty eight patients received increasing doses of beclomethasone with (group S) or without (group MDI) a 750 ml spacer. The daily dose was increased by 0.5 mg at monthly intervals until hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal suppression developed or a dose of 5 mg/day was achieved. Asthma symptoms and peak expiratory flow were recorded daily.RESULTS: Twenty three patients completed the study, one (group S) reaching a dose of 5 mg beclomethasone dipropionate daily without hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal suppression. Reasons for withdrawal were poor compliance (n = 10), the patient's decision (n = 3), and asthma that was too unstable (n = 2). \"Intention to treat\" analysis showed that the median dose of beclomethasone causing hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal suppression was similar in the two groups (3.25 mg in S v 3.0 mg in MDI; 95% confidence interval (CI) for difference -1.0 to 1.0 mg). At 2 mg/day of beclomethasone most patients in both groups had well controlled asthma and there were no differences in symptoms or peak flow between the groups. Good control at this dose did not permit conclusions to be drawn about the efficacy of higher doses.CONCLUSIONS: There is wide interindividual variation in the dose of beclomethasone dipropionate causing hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal suppression. Whether or not a spacer is used, doses higher than the currently accepted maximum of 2 mg/day can be taken by many adults with asthma without causing subnormal function of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. Whether these higher doses are more effective in controlling asthma remains to be established.",

    "abstract": "An open, crossover and randomized study was carried out to compare the safety and efficacy of salbutamol inhaled using the dry-powder inhaler Turbuhaler, and using a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI). Twelve patients with moderate to severe asthma, aged 47-68 years, were included in the study. On two separate days, patients received a total dose of 1600 micrograms of salbutamol administered in a cumulative dose fashion: 100, 100, 200, 400 and 800 micrograms at 3-min intervals. Salbutamol inhaled via Turbuhaler caused a larger decrease in serum potassium concentration than did salbutamol inhaled via pMDI. The estimated relative dose potency of the hypokalaemic effect of salbutamol Turbuhaler vs salbutamol pMDI was 2.0 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.3-3.6. Turbuhaler caused a small (but statistically significantly greater than with pMDI) increase in heart rate, QTc interval and tremor. Blood pressure was unaffected by the treatments. No adverse events of clinical relevance were reported. The estimated relative dose potency of the bronchodilating effect (FEV1) of salbutamol Turbuhaler vs salbutamol pMDI was 3.0 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.8-5.8. In conclusion, salbutamol inhaled via Turbuhaler was more potent and seemed to have a better therapeutic ratio than salbutamol inhaled via pMDI. Both treatments were equally well tolerated.",

The dose of nicardipine used was 60 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. 3. Mean ambulatory blood pressure was reduced from 164 +/- 5.3/97 +/- 2.9 to 151 +/- 5.2/88 +/- 2.4 mmHg (P less than 0.01); this effect was shown to be sustained for 8 h after the morning dose.

    "title": "A large volume spacer significantly reduces the effect of inhaled steroids on bone formation.",
    "abstract": "Inhaled steroids are increasingly advocated as first line treatment for mild asthma. Some studies suggest that inhaled steroids suppress bone formation as reflected by a fall in plasma osteocalcin. Spacers have been shown to increase the proportion of inhaled aerosol that is deposited in the lungs and to reduce the amount swallowed. We measured plasma osteocalcin levels to determine the effect on bone formation of inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) with and without a 750 ml spacer in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Twenty-six healthy male volunteers took BDP 500 micrograms (two puffs of Becloforte) together with two puffs of placebo, inhaled twice daily for seven days. One inhaler was taken directly while the other was inhaled through a 750 ml spacer. After a two week washout period, the inhalers were exchanged so that BDP was taken by the alternate route for a further seven days. Fasting plasma osteocalcin levels were measured at 09.00 h before and at the end of each week. After a week of BDP taken directly (without a spacer), osteocalcin levels fell from 11.8 (SEM 0.6) ng/ml to 9.5 (SEM 0.5) ng/ml (p < 0.001). After a week of BDP taken through a spacer, osteocalcin levels fell from 12.1 (SEM 0.5) ng/ml to 11.1 (SEM 0.5) ng/ml (p < 0.001). The fall in osteocalcin when a spacer was used was significantly less than when BDP was taken directly (p < 0.005). This is likely to be because the systemic effects on bone are caused by swallowed rather than inhaled BDP, and this is limited by the use of a spacer. Spacers should be more widely prescribed with inhaled steroids. Further prospective studies are indicated to evaluate whether spacers protect bone mass.",

    "abstract": "Given daily, low molecular weight (LMW) heparins are established for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT). We describe delivery by a novel, needle-less device that is virtually painless in action. Its use could provide benefits for patients in terms of comfort both psychologically and physically, and for healthcare workers in terms of safety from needle-stick injury. Patients undergoing elective surgery received LMW heparin delivered subcutaneously by either a standard needle and syringe or by the needle-less injection device, J-Tip. Pain was scored at the time of injection and plasma anti-factor Xa levels compared between the two methods of drug delivery 4 h later: 29 patients received LMW heparin delivered by the J-Tip and 31 patients by standard needle and syringe. The J-Tip was significantly more comfortable for the patient as the method of drug delivery (P < 0.001). When delivered by the J-Tip, LMW heparin was equally as efficacious, as plasma anti-factor Xa levels were similar for both methods of delivery (P < 0.42). In summary, delivery of LMW heparin by the J-Tip device was both comfortable and effective. These findings, taken in conjunction with its ease of use and complete freedom from risk of needle-stick injury might encourage further examination and use of this type of product.",

All participants were stabilised on maximally tolerated doses of CBZ as monotherapy (one twice daily, twelve three times daily, eight four times daily). Each preparation was taken with a matched placebo of the other for 4 weeks. 2. Peak serum CBZ concentrations (mean +/- s.e. mean) were lower (CBZ 11.4 +/- 0.4 mg l-1; CBZ-CR 10.4 +/- 0.5 mg l-1; P less than 0.01) and times to peak longer (CBZ 3.6 +/- 0.5 h, CBZ-CR 5.2 +/- 0.7 h, P less than 0.01) during CBZ-CR treatment. Mean CBZ concentrations, however, were also slightly reduced with the new formulation (CBZ 9.9 +/- 0.3 mg l-1; CBZ-CR 9.1 +/- 0.5 mg l-1, P less than 0.05) and this was associated with greater seizure frequency (CBZ 2.8 +/- 1.2, CBZ-CR 3.8 +/- 0.9; P less than 0.05) during the CBZ-CR treatment phase. 3.

    "abstract": "The optimal timing for discontinuing treatment with a long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog (TAP-144SR) was investigated in patients with central precocious puberty (CPP). Thirty-five girls with CPP (21 with idiopathic disease and 14 with organic disease) were treated with the analog for 3 to 5 years. No significant differences were seen between the idiopathic and the organic CPP in the suppressive effect of bone maturation. Advancement of bone maturation was noticeably suppressed during the period between bone ages (BA) of 11.0 and 11.9. The height standard deviation score (Ht-SDS) for BA was consistently improved from 10 to 11.5 years of BA, and patients reached peak Ht-SDS at a BA of 11.5 years. The deltaHt-SDS (annual change in Ht-SDS) was noticeably decreased at BA over 12 years in spite of prolongation of the treatment. In the eight patients who have reached final height, the average Ht-SDS was -0.49 at end of the treatment (BA 11.7 years) and the final Ht-SDS was - 1.1 SD, respectively. Predicted adult height at the end of the treatment was significantly higher than the actual final height (P<0.01). The results suggest that a fall in Ht-SDS for BA which usually occurs at approximately 12 years of BA, is an indication for cessation of the treatment with TAP-144SR, and residual growth potential judged solely from BA may be decreased in girls with CPP after discontinuation of the treatment.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To define sleep disturbances in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and explore the association between carbamazepine (CBZ) therapy, sleep, and daytime somnolence.METHODS: We recorded nocturnal polysomnography and measured subjective and objective daytime somnolence in a group of newly diagnosed TLE patients, who had no evidence of anatomic brain lesion on neuroimaging and had never been treated before. Recordings were performed at baseline, after the initial administration of 400 mg CBZ-controlled release (CR) and after 1 month of treatment (400 mg twice daily b.i.d.). The findings were compared with those of a group of young healthy volunteers, both at baseline and after the first administration of CBZ. The chronic effect of CBZ-CR treatment was evaluated only in TLE patients.RESULTS: At baseline, nocturnal sleep patterns of TLE patients did not show marked alterations when the influence of seizures, cerebral lesions, and drugs had been ruled out. In both the TLE and the control groups, initiation of CBZ therapy provoked a reduction and a fragmentation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and an increase in the number of sleep stage shifts. In the TLE group, these effects were almost completely reversed after 1 month of treatment, and no significant difference was noted between baseline condition and long-term follow-up. With regard to daytime sleepiness, initial administration of the drug caused an increase in objective sleepiness only in the control group. Subjective sleepiness was higher in the control group than in the TLE group but was not modified by the drug.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that CBZ-CR has negative effects on REM sleep during initial administration but chronic treatment does not significantly modify nocturnal sleep or daytime somnolence.",

    "abstract": "Dry cows and pregnant heifers from 25 farms near Guelph, Ontario, Canada were enrolled in a large, double-blind, randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the impact of monensin on energy metabolism, health, and production. A total of 503 cows was given monensin in controlled-release capsules, and 507 cows were administered placebo capsules 3 wk before expected calving date. The effects of treatment on health were evaluated using a logistic regression model. Treatment with monensin significantly reduced the incidence of abomasal displacement (OR = 0.41-0.84) and multiple illnesses (OR = 0.38-0.89). Monensin treatment tended to reduce the incidence of clinical ketosis (P = 0.11) and the risk of being culled (P = 0.09) in the first 94 d of lactation. Reproductive performance was analyzed with both a logistic regression model for conception rate and a survival analysis for days to first breeding and days from calving to conception. Treatment with monensin had no significant effect on any measure of reproductive performance.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of depot and standard release form of triptoreline in superovulation induction in IVF programs.DESIGN: One hundred ninety-six patients undergoing IVF were randomized between two treatment groups. Pituitary desensitization was obtained in group 1 (102 patients) with a single IM injection of 3.75 mg D-Trp-6-luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) and, in group 2 (94 patients), with daily SC administration of 0.1 mg D-Trp-6-LH-RH. In a subgroup of 11 patients, a series of GnRH tests was performed to investigate pituitary desensitization and, in another subgroup of 12 patients, a study of luteal phase steroid profile was performed. In an additional 23 patients, a series of GnRH tests were performed to investigate pituitary desensitization during the late follicular and midluteal phases.RESULTS: No differences were found in the time necessary to reach desensitization (11.3 +/- 1.03 versus 11.3 +/- 1.45 days; mean +/- SEM), whereas resumption of pituitary activity takes place in 7 days after the discontinuation of the daily form and in about 2 months after discontinuation of the depot form. No differences were found in the duration of stimulation, number of FSH ampules, E2 levels, and number of follicles (11.7 +/- 0.68, versus 12.2 +/- 0.68) on hCG administration day and the total oocytes collected (9.1 +/- 0.6 versus 9.2 +/- 0.64). Oocyte quality, percentage of fertilization and cleavage, pregnancy rate per transfer (28.7% versus 25.6%), and miscarriages (about 30%) were similar in the two protocols. No difference was found in hormonal levels during the luteal phase. In both groups there was a high incidence of multiple pregnancy.CONCLUSION: Comparable results can be achieved with both long-acting and standard-release forms of GnRH analogs in patients undergoing assisted reproduction in terms of follicular stimulation and abortion rates despite differences in the duration of pituitary suppression.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between endometriosis and preclinical abortions and to evaluate the effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRH-a) therapy on these pregnancies.DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Of 67 women with severe endometriosis referred to us for in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET), 32 underwent ovarian stimulation for oocyte retrieval with menotropins (protocol A), whereas the other 35 were admitted for the procedure after a 6-month period of hormonal suppression with a GnRH agonist (protocol B). The clinical impact of the preclinical and clinical pregnancies in both treatment protocols were evaluated on the basis of oocyte classification and embryo quality score.SETTING: All patients were treated in our IVF Unit.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical pregnancy was used as our main outcome measure of success.RESULTS: A significantly higher number of preclinical pregnancies (P less than 0.0001) occurred in patients treated by protocol A. After GnRH-a treatment, the preclinical pregnancy rate declined significantly (P less than 0.0001), whereas the clinical pregnancy rate per cycle and per transfer rose significantly (P less than 0.0001 and P less than 0.0001, respectively). Furthermore, clinical pregnancies had a significantly better mean embryo quality score in comparison with preclinical pregnancies (P less than 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that combining GnRH-a therapy before IVF-ET provides an improved treatment modality for preclinical abortions and infertility associated with severe endometriosis.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of a new inhaled corticosteroid, fluticasone propionate at a total daily dose of 200 micrograms, with beclomethasone dipropionate 400 micrograms/day in childhood asthma. A total of 398 asthmatic children (aged 4-19 years) were randomised to receive either fluticasone propionate 200 micrograms daily or beclomethasone dipropionate 400 micrograms daily for six weeks inhaled via a spacer device from a metered dose inhaler. During the study the patients recorded morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), symptom scores, and use of beta 2 agonist rescue medication. In addition, clinic visit PEFR and forced expiratory volume in one second were measured. Safety was assessed by recording all adverse events and by performing routine biochemistry and haematology screens including plasma cortisol concentration before and after treatment. For the purposes of analysis the diary card data were grouped into three periods: week 3 (days 15-21), week 6 (days 36-42), and weeks 1-6 (days 1-42). The results showed no significant difference between treatments on most efficacy parameters. However, there were significant differences in changes from baseline in favour of fluticasone propionate for % predicted morning PEFR both at week 3 (fluticasone propionate 6.1%, beclomethasone dipropionate 3.9%) and at week 6 (fluticasone propionate 8.3%, beclomethasone dipropionate 5. 9%) and % predicted evening PEFR at week 6 (fluticasone propionate 7.3%, beclomethasone dipropionate 4.9% and over weeks 1-6 (fluticasone propionate 5.5%, beclomethasone dipropionate 3.6%. Comparison between groups showed that the group receiving fluticasone propionate had a lower % of days with symptom-free exercise at week 6 (fluticasone propionate 87%, beclomethasone dipropionate 81%) and % days without rescue medication at week 6 (fluticasone propionate 87%, beclomethasone dipropionate 80%) and over weeks 1-6 (fluticasone propionate 80%, beclomethasone dipropionate 73%). Except for a higher incidence of sore throat in the fluticasone propionate group, the two treatments did not differ with regard to safety. There was no evidence of adrenal suppression with either treatment. In conclusion, fluticasone propionate 200 microgram daily ws at least as effective and as well tolerated as beclomethasone dipropionate 400 microgram daily in childhood asthma.",

    "abstract": "To compare the disposition of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and its acetylated metabolite during treatment with olsalazine and mesalazine, 14 patients with inactive ulcerative colitis were randomly assigned to olsalazine (1 g twice daily) and the mesalazines, Asacol (800 + 400 + 800 mg daily), Pentasa (750 + 500 + 750 mg daily), and Salofalk (750 + 500 + 750 mg daily) in a crossover design trial so that all received each drug for seven days. Intraluminal colonic concentrations of 5-ASA were estimated after five days by the method of equilibrium in vivo dialysis of faeces. A predose serum sample and a 24 hour urine collection were obtained on day seven. The 5-ASA and acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (Ac-5-ASA) values were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Olsalazine almost doubled the colonic concentrations (mean 23.7 (SEM) (1.9) mmol/l) of its therapeutically active ingredient (5-ASA) compared with equimolar doses of Pentasa (12.6 (2.2) mmol/l; p less than 0.0003) and Salofalk (15.0 (2.0) mmol/l; p less than 0.003). At the same time, olsalazine treatment was associated with lower serum concentrations and urinary excretions (p less than 0.05) of 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA compared with the mesalazine preparations. The low systemic load of 5-ASA provided by olsalazine reduces the potential risk of nephrotoxicity during long term treatment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Variceal bleeding is a severe complication of portal hypertension. Somatostatin reduces portal pressure by decreasing splanchnic blood flow, and nitrates by diminishing intrahepatic resistance. Experimental studies have shown that the combination of somatostatin and nitrates has an additive effect in decreasing portal pressure.AIM: To compare the therapeutic efficacy of either intravenous infusion of somatostatin plus oral isosorbide 5-mononitrate or somatostatin alone in gastro-oesophageal variceal bleeding associated with liver cirrhosis.METHODS: A unicentre, double blind, placebo controlled, clinical trial was conducted. Sixty patients bleeding from oesophageal or gastric varices were randomised to receive intravenous infusion of somatostatin (250 microg/hour) plus oral isosorbide 5-mononitrate (40 mg/12 hours) (group I) or somatostatin infusion plus placebo (group II) for 72 hours.RESULTS: The two groups of patients had similar clinical, endoscopic, and haematological characteristics. Control of bleeding was achieved in 18 out of 30 patients (60%) in group I and 26 out of 30 patients (87%) in group II (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in mean transfusion requirements between the two groups: 2.6 (2.2) v 1.8 (1.6) respectively; means (SD). Mortality and side effects were similar in the two groups, but development of ascites was higher in group I (30%) than in group II (7%) (p<0.05).CONCLUSION: In cirrhotic patients with acute gastro-oesophageal variceal bleeding, addition of isosorbide 5-mononitrate to somatostatin does not improve therapeutic efficacy, induces more adverse effects, and should not be used.",

    "title": "Comparative nasal effects of bradykinin and histamine: influence on nasal airways resistance and plasma protein exudation.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bradykinin may contribute to the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis. Like histamine, nasal challenge with bradykinin induces rhinorrhoea, nasal blockage, and plasma protein leakage. Their comparative nasal potencies have not, however, been fully elucidated.METHODS: Three double blind, randomised, placebo controlled and cross-over studies were undertaken to compare objectively the nasal effects of bradykinin, histamine, and vehicle.RESULTS: Both bradykinin and histamine produced dose dependent increases in nasal airways resistance (NAR). There was no significant difference in the effects of bradykinin and histamine on NAR at any dose level. On a molar basis, however, bradykinin was 6.98 times more potent than histamine in inducing a 50% increase in NAR. Nasal challenge with bradykinin and histamine also induced significant rhinorrhoea compared with vehicle. The amount of rhinorrhoea induced by histamine was significantly greater than that induced by bradykinin at any dose level. Bradykinin and histamine induced dose dependent nasal pain and nasal itch respectively. When administered as single doses both bradykinin (1.9 mumol) and histamine (1.9 mumol) induced significant rhinorrhoea compared with the vehicle. The volume of rhinorrhoea secretions induced by histamine was 29% greater than that induced by bradykinin. In contrast, although NAR was increased significantly more by histamine than by the vehicle, the effect of bradykinin on NAR was significantly greater than histamine and vehicle in both magnitude and duration of effect. The incremental effect of bradykinin on lavage albumin levels was also significantly greater than both histamine and vehicle.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the nasal vascular effects of histamine are less prominent than its actions on rhinorrhoea, and that the greater obstructive effect of bradykinin than histamine on NAR may contribute to the relative lack of efficacy of H1 antihistamines on nasal blockage in clinical disease.",

    "title": "Aerosol deposition in the human lung following administration from a microprocessor controlled pressurised metered dose inhaler.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gamma scintigraphy was employed to assess the deposition of aerosols emitted from a pressurised metered dose inhaler (MDI) contained in a microprocessor controlled device (SmartMist), a system which analyses an inspiratory flow profile and automatically actuates the MDI when predefined conditions of flow rate and cumulative inspired volume coincide.METHODS: Micronised salbutamol particles contained in a commercial MDI (Ventolin) were labelled with 99m-technetium using a method validated by the determination of (1) aerosol size characteristics of the drug and radiotracer following actuation into an eight stage cascade impactor and (2) shot potencies of these non-volatile components as a function of actuation number. Using nine healthy volunteers in a randomised factorial interaction design the effect of inspiratory flow rate (slow, 30 l/min; medium, 90 l/min; fast, 270 l/min) combined with cumulative inspired volume (early, 300 ml; late, 3000 ml) was determined on total and regional aerosol lung deposition using the technique of gamma scintigraphy.RESULTS: The SmartMist firing at the medium/early setting (medium flow and early in the cumulative inspired volume) resulted in the highest lung deposition at 18.6 (1.42)%. The slow/early setting gave the second highest deposition at 14.1 (2.06)% with the fast/late setting resulting in the lowest (7.6 (1.15)%). Peripheral lung deposition obtained for the medium/early (9.1 (0.9)%) and slow/early (7.5 (1.06)%) settings were equivalent but higher than those obtained with the other treatments. This reflected the lower total lung deposition at these other settings as no difference in regional deposition, expressed as a volume corrected central zone:peripheral zone ratio, was apparent for all modes of inhalation studied.CONCLUSIONS: The SmartMist device allowed reproducible actuation of an MDI at a preprogrammed point during inspiration. The extent of aerosol deposition in the lung is affected by a change in firing point and is promoted by an inhaled flow rate of up to 90 l/min-that is, the slow and medium setting used in these studies.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To present efficacy and cycle control data pooled from three pivotal studies of the contraceptive patch (Ortho Evra/Evra).DESIGN: Three multicenter, open-label, contraceptive studies that included up to 13 treatment cycles.SETTING: 183 centers.PATIENT(S): 3,319 women.INTERVENTION(S): Three consecutive 7-day patches (21 days) with 1 patch-free week per cycle.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Contraceptive efficacy and cycle control.RESULT(S): Overall and method failure life-table estimates of contraceptive failure through 13 cycles were 0.8% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.3%) and 0.6% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.9%), respectively. Corresponding Pearl indices were 0.88 (95% CI, 0.44-1.33) and 0.7 (95% CI, 0.31-1.10). Contraceptive failure among women with a body weight < 90 kg (<198 lb) was low and uniformly distributed across the weight range. A subgroup of women with body weight > or = 90 kg (> or = 198 lb) may have increased risk of pregnancy. The incidence of breakthrough bleeding was low and decreased over time.CONCLUSION(S): In contraceptive patch users, the overall annual probability of pregnancy was 0.8% and the method failure probability was 0.6%. The efficacy of the patch was high and similar across age and racial groups. Among women < 90 kg (<198 lb), contraceptive failure was low and uniformly distributed across the range of body weights. In women > or = 90 kg (> or = 198 lb), contraceptive failures may be increased. Efficacy and cycle control have been shown to be comparable to an established oral contraceptive.",

    "abstract": "An open-label, multicenter study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of oral risedronate (a pyridinyl bisphosphonate) in 162 patients (102 men, 60 postmenopausal women; mean age, 68 years) with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone (mean serum alkaline phosphatase [ALP] approximately seven times the upper limit of normal). Patients were treated with oral risedronate, 30 mg/day for 84 days, followed by 112 days without treatment. This 196-day cycle was repeated once if serum ALP did not normalize or increased from the nadir value by > or = 25%. At the end of the first and second cycles, the mean percentage decreases for serum ALP were 65.7% and 69.1%, and for urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine 50.4% and 66.9%, respectively. The decreases from baseline in ALP and urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine were significant (p < 0.001). Normalization of serum ALP was observed in 86 patients (53.8%): 53 during the first treatment cycle and 33 during the second. There was a significant proportion of patients reporting a decrease in the pagetic bone pain at days 84 and 196 (p < 0.001). Overall, risedronate was well tolerated. Five patients withdrew due to adverse events, none of which were considered to be drug related. In conclusion, 30 mg of oral risedronate administered daily for 84 days significantly reduced the biochemical indices of disease activity and was associated with pain reduction in patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. Normalization of ALP was observed in the majority of patients. Repeated administration of risedronate was shown to be beneficial. In general, risedronate was well tolerated and demonstrated a good safety profile.",

Both amlodipine and metoprolol significantly increased total exercise time, total workload, time to onset of angina and time to 1 mm ST-depression with no significant differences between the drugs. Amlodipine was significantly more efficient than metoprolol in reducing ST-depression at maximum workload. Diary data revealed no differences in patients' self-rating of drug effects.CONCLUSIONS: Judged by suppression of subjective symptoms and performance on exercise tolerance tests amlodipine represents a useful alternative to metoprolol as monotherapy in stable angina pectoris.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mucormycosis (or zygomycosis) is the term for infection caused by fungi of the order Mucorales. Mucoraceae may produce severe disease in susceptible individuals, notably patients with diabetes and leukemia. Rhinocerebral mucormycosis most commonly manifests itself in the setting of poorly controlled diabetes, especially with ketoacidosis.CASE PRESENTATION: A 31-year-old diabetic man presented to the outpatient clinic with the following signs and symptoms: headache, periorbital pain, swelling and loss of vision in the right eye. On physical examination his right eye was red and swollen. There was periorbital cellulitis and the conjunctiva was edematous. KOH preparation of purulent discharge showed broad, ribbonlike, aseptate hyphae when examined under a fluorescence microscope. Cranial MRI showed involvement of the right orbit, thrombosis in cavernous sinus and infiltrates at ethmoid and maxillary sinuses. Mucormycosis was diagnosed based on these findings. Amphotericin B (AmBisome(R); 2 mg/kg.d) was initiated after the test doses. Right orbitectomy and right partial maxillectomy were performed; the lesions in ethmoid and maxillary sinuses were removed. The duration of the liposomal amphotericin B therapy was approximately 6 months and the total dose of liposomal amphotericin B used was 32 grams. Liposomal amphotericin B therapy was stopped six months later and oral fluconazole was started.CONCLUSIONS: Although a total surgical debridement of the lesions could not be performed, it is remarkable that regression of the disease could be achieved with medical therapy alone.",

The trial was randomized using a triple cross-over design. A burning sensation was reported in 60%, 12% and 0% of subjects up to 15 min after administration of diazepam 35 mg, diazepam 10 mg and placebo, respectively. Endoscopic assessment 24 h after medication showed mechanical irritation in three subjects and local irritation probably caused by diazepam, the vehicle, or both, in four. No correlation was found between subjective complaints and objective findings. Control endoscopy 7 days after medication revealed no pathology. It is suggested that a rectal solution of diazepam in doses up to 0.5 mg kg-1 is a safe form of medication in respect of irritation of the rectal mucosa.",

    "title": "What intervals in oral therapy of isosorbide dinitrate in various doses are sufficient to prevent nitrate tolerance?",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONS: The organic nitrates are effective anti-anginal drugs during initial treatment, but their therapeutic value is compromised by the rapid development of tolerance during sustained therapy. The only widely accepted method of preventing tolerance is the use of intermittent administration, but without specifying to what extent the length of interval is dependent on type and dose of nitrate. The aim of this study was to evaluate how long periods free of nitrates are sufficient to prevent tolerance in long-term therapy with oral sustained-release isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN).MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a double-blind study, 38 patients with stable angina, received ISDN: 40 mg, 80 mg and 120 mg or placebo in the first ingestion (1st) and in long-term therapy in four 7 day phases: 4-times-daily (4x), 3-times-daily (3x) with 12 h nitrate-free interval, twice-daily (2x) with 18 h interval and once-daily (1x). After 1st and on the last day of each long-term phases, exercise tests with the analysis of walking times: total, to angina and to ischaemia (WTI) were performed: preceding ingestion, 2 h and 6 h after.RESULTS: Six hours after 1st all doses WTI improved significantly in comparison to placebo (p < 0.0001): 40 mg by 52.5%, 80 mg by 66.0% and 120 mg by 58.4%. None of the ISDN doses improved significantly WTI in 4x phase; in 3x, only 40 mg by 12.1% (p < 0.05); in 2x, only 80 mg by 22.3% (p < 0.05) and in once-daily, 80 mg by 27.2% and 120 mg by 36.2% (p < 0.01).CONCLUSION: 12 h nitrate-free interval is sufficient in order to prevent tolerance in long-term treatment of sustained-release ISDN with 40 mg dose, 18 h with 80 mg and 24 h with 120 mg doses.",

Then, patients inhaled 1.5 U/kg insulin by aerosol into the lungs 5 min before ingesting a test meal. On the second visit, patients inhaled placebo aerosol 5 min before ingesting the same meal. On both visits, plasma samples were collected and analyzed for glucose levels for 3 h during the postprandial state.MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: No one coughed after inhalation of insulin aerosol or demonstrated hypoglycemia. During the postprandial period, glucose levels were significantly lower at 20 min (5.12+/-1.08 mmol/L), 1 h (7.87+/-0.73 mmol/L), 2 h (8.05+/-1.24 mmol/L) and 3 h (7.50+/-1.43 mmol/L) following inhalation of insulin than when the placebo was used. Data for the placebo were 10.36+/-1.23 mmol/L at 20 min, 14.0+/-1.68 mmol/L at 1 h, 16.18+/-1.45 mmol/L at 2 h, and 14.37+/-2.11 mmol/L at 3h (for all comparisons, p < 0.05). On the insulin visit, glucose levels were < 11.2 mmol/L 2 h after the meal in six of seven patients. None attained this level at the placebo visit. In addition, glucose levels were within the normal postprandial range of < 7.84 mmol/L in four of seven patients 2 h after eating on the insulin visit.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, once plasma glucose levels are normalized, postprandial glucose levels can be maintained below diabetic levels by delivering 1.5 U/kg insulin into the lungs 5 min before the ingestion of a meal.",

    "title": "Relative bioavailability of salbutamol to the lung following inhalation using metered dose inhalation methods and spacer devices.",
    "abstract": "Comment in    Thorax. 1994 Nov;49(11):1183. doi: 10.1136/thx.49.11.1183.BACKGROUND: Inhalation aids do not require coordination between actuation of a metered dose inhaler (MDI) with inspiration and reduce oropharyngeal impaction. The delivery of salbutamol to the lung and systemic availability following inhalation with three commonly used spacers and an open mouth technique have been evaluated using a simple noninvasive technique based on urinary excretion 30 minutes and 24 hours after the dose.METHODS: Ten healthy subjects inhaled, on randomised study days, 4 x 100 micrograms from a Ventolin MDI and, subsequently, with the aid of a Volumatic, Bricanyl Spacer, and Nebuhaler spacer device. In addition, an open mouth inhaler technique was evaluated. Urine samples were collected 0-30 minutes and 0.5-24 hours after inhalation. From these samples the relative bioavailability to the lung (urinary salbutamol excretion 30 minutes after dosing) and the systemic bioavailability of the dose (24 hour urinary excretion of salbutamol and its metabolite) for each inhalation method was obtained.RESULTS: The mean (SD) urinary excretion of salbutamol 30 minutes after inhalation using the MDI alone and with the Volumatic, Bricanyl Spacer, Nebuhaler, and open mouth technique was 2.83 (0.78)%, 3.37 (0.69)%, 4.09 (0.91)%, 4.34 (1.60)%, and 3.49 (0.98)%, respectively, expressed as a percentage of the nominal dose. The nebuhaler and Bricanyl Spacer spacer devices were found to increase the relative bioavailability of salbutamol to the lung compared with the MDI alone. Compared with the MDI the inhalation aid increases were much greater than the intra-individual variability of the urinary excretion method. In 11 individuals who each repeated the same inhalation procedure on four separate occasions, the mean (SD) coefficient of variation was 8.24 (2.36)%. The mean (SD) 24 hour urinary excretion of salbutamol and its metabolites was 26.6 (6.79), 27.0 (7.95), and 55.6 (9.74)% of the salbutamol dose for the Volumatic, Nebuhaler, and MDI, respectively. Similar values following the open mouth method and Bricanyl Spacer were 48.9 (10.97)% and 43.8 (11.57)%. These values, representing the systemic availability of the inhaled dose, were lower when inhaling with the aid of the Volumatic and Nebuhaler than inhalation from the MDI alone.CONCLUSIONS: Spacer devices improve pulmonary bioavailability of salbutamol and reduce the systemically available dose.",

    "title": "Sources of variability in nicotine and cotinine levels with use of nicotine nasal spray, transdermal nicotine, and cigarette smoking.",
    "abstract": "AIMS: Nicotine nasal spray and transdermal nicotine are effective aids to smoking cessation, and are being evaluated for treatment of other medical diseases. Wide variation in levels of nicotine and its metabolite, cotinine, have been observed with such therapies. This study aimed primarily to assess sources of individual variability in nicotine and metabolite plasma levels from these dosing systems and from cigarette smoking.METHODS: Twelve cigarette smokers, studied on a clinical research ward, received four treatments of 5 days duration each, including (1) cigarette smoking, 16 cigarettes/day; (2) transdermal nicotine, 15 mg/day; (3) nicotine nasal spray, 24-1 mg doses/day; (4) placebo nicotine nasal spray, 24 doses/day. On a different occasion, the disposition kinetics of nicotine and cotinine were determined via infusion of deuterium-labeled nicotine and continine. Plasma levels of nicotine, cotinine, and 3'-hydroxycotinine and daily intake of nicotine during various treatments were examined, as well as pharmacokinetic factors that determined plasma nicotine and continine levels.RESULTS: There was considerable individual variation in plasma nicotine and cotinine levels and in the daily of nicotine absorbed from various delivery systems, with most variability with nicotine nasal spray (fivefold) and least for transdermal nicotine (two-to threefold). Plasma nicotine levels were determined most strongly by nicotine clearance. Continine levels were determined most strongly by dose of nicotine and, to a lesser extent, the clearance of cotinine and fractional conversion of nicotine to continine.CONCLUSIONS: Plasma levels of nicotine and cotinine produced by nicotine therapies are highly variable, due to both wide variability in individual pharmacokinetics and in dose delivery from the products. To compensate for individual differences in clearance, individualization of nicotine dosing based on therapeutic drug monitoring with comparison to nicotine or continine levels during cigarette smoking prior to treatment may be necessary to optimize nicotine therapy. This study also validates a recently proposed method for estimating absolute bioavailability of a drug using drug and metabolite pharmacokinetic data, and presents novel data on plasma levels of the metabolite trans-3'-hydroxycotinine in people.",

    "abstract": "Generic substitution of salbutamol lags behind that of other drugs in Scotland and a negative perception by both patients and doctors may explain this. The aim of this study was to assess whether, in clinical practice, there was any difference in efficacy between branded salbutamol (Ventolin) and a generic preparation. Asthmatic patients using a Ventolin metered-dose inhaler at least twice a day for symptom relief were entered into a double-blind cross-over study, comparing Ventolin, blinded Ventolin and a generic salbutamol in random order for two weeks each. Daily peak flows, inhaler use and bronchodilator response were recorded. At the end of each treatment period patients rated their inhaler against their usual Ventolin on a 5-point scale. Forty patients were entered into the study; 90% received 1000 micrograms or more of inhaled steroids per day. Eleven patients dropped out during the run-in phase. In the remaining 29 patients, no significant difference between treatments could be found in any of the objective parameters measured. Fifty-five per cent of patients said they could detect a difference between the inhalers, and 45% noted a difference between their usual Ventolin and the open or blinded Ventolin. This study showed clinical equivalence between a generic and branded salbutamol. Patients' own assessment of their relief inhaler seems to be influenced by factors other than efficacy. The study highlights that careful encouragement is required when changing to a generic product and has particular implications for the forthcoming conversion to CFC-free products.",

In group B (n = 64) GnRH-a was initiated during the luteal phase and in group C (n = 35) during the follicular phase.RESULTS: We found (1) no differences in fertilization and implantation rates between the three protocols; (2) similar pregnancy rates per transfer when similar number of conceptus were transferred (A = 30%, B = 22%, C = 21%); (3) an increase of the number of oocytes obtained; and (4) a reduction in the cancellation rate with both GnRH-a protocols.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that there is no obvious superiority between the two GnRH-a protocols in the dosage schedule used and that the major advantage of GnRH-a over non-GnRH-a protocols is in decreasing the cancellation rate and increasing the number of oocytes and conceptus obtained. The follicular phase GnRH-a protocol required less hMG-pure FSH than the luteal phase GnRH-a protocol.",

    "abstract": "The first of a second generation of slow-release injectable contraceptives is the norethindrone (NET) microspheres with a 90-day duration of action. It was evaluated at 65-mg and 100-mg doses for safety and contraceptive effectiveness in two randomized, single-blind trials among 131 women: 94 women for 12 months and 37 women for 6 months. The 6-month trial included additional evaluations of ovarian function and serum NET values. In the 6-month trial, no indication of ovulation was detected in the 100-mg dose group, while 3 of the 19 women in the 65-mg group showed signs of ovulation (progesterone greater than 3 ng/ml). No pregnancies were reported in the 100-mg group and one pregnancy in the 65-mg group resulted in a life-table pregnancy rate for that dose of 2.6 per 100 woman-years (95% confidence interval, 0 to 7.5). Days of vaginal bleeding were analyzed for 30 days before treatment and in 90-day reference periods after treatment. The mean number of vaginal bleeding and spotting days increased initially after the first injection in both dose groups, but decreased to below baseline in both dose groups after 6 months. The two doses appear comparable in clinical safety, side effects, vaginal bleeding patterns, and laboratory measures. With the preliminary estimate of efficacy, the 65-mg dose would be the minimally effective dose for the NET 90-day injectable contraceptive.",

The cohort included 184 patients who underwent arbutamine stress testing, of whom 122 (catheterization group) had angiographically defined coronary artery disease ( > or = 50% diameter stenosis of a major coronary artery), and 62 had a low pretest likelihood of coronary artery disease (low likelihood group). A subset of 69 patients from the catheterization group underwent both arbutamine and exercise stress testing.RESULTS: Hemodynamic responses during arbutamine and exercise stress testing demonstrated no significant difference in percent increase in heart rate (81% vs. 76%) or systolic blood pressure (26% vs. 30%). The sensitivity for detecting coronary artery disease ( > or = 50% stenosis) using arbutamine thallium-201 SPECT was 87% (95% for detecting > or = 70% stenoses), and the normalcy rate in the low likelihood group was 90%. In patients completing both arbutamine and exercise stress testing, thallium-201 SPECT sensitivity for detecting coronary artery disease ( > or = 50% stenosis) was 94% and 97% (p = NS), respectively Furthermore, SPECT segmental visual score agreement (defect vs. no defect) showed a concordance of 92% between arbutamine and exercise results (kappa 0.80, p < 0.001). The stress thallium-201 SPECT segmental scores showed 83% exact agreement (kappa 0.69, p < 0.001), and analysis of the reversibility of segments with stress perfusion defects demonstrated 86% exact agreement (kappa 0.68, p < 0.001). In general, side effects associated with arbutamine were well tolerated and resolved with discontinuation of infusion.CONCLUSIONS: Arbutamine, administered by a closed-loop feed-back system was shown to be a safe and effective pharmacologic stress agent. Arbutamine stress thallium-201 SPECT appears to be accurate for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease with a diagnostic efficacy similar to that of treadmill exercise thallium-201 studies.",

The recovery of BDP and its metabolite beclomethasone 17-monopropionate (B17P) in ileostomy effluent was investigated in a cross-over study after administration of formulations I or II or a reference capsule containing micronised BDP, and in a second open study after administration of formulation III. Radio-opaque granules were coadministered for evaluation of gastrointestinal passage. Ileostomy effluents were collected hourly for 10-12 h following drug intake. After marker beads had been counted on X-rays, ileostomy collections were analysed for BDP and its metabolites. Cumulative recovery, lag-time and mean transit time were determined for drug and marker beads.RESULTS: Gastrointestinal passage characteristics were similar for all treatments. Total drug recovery was approximately three times higher for the sustained-release formulations than for the reference capsule. Recovery of B17P from stoma fluid samples was significantly lower for formulation III than for formulations I and II.CONCLUSIONS: The novel oral formulations delivered substantial amounts of steroid drug at the distal small bowel/proximal colon, which may warrant further studies to evaluate clinical applicability.",

    "abstract": "Comment in    Can Vet J. 1999 Mar;40(3):151-2.This field trial was designed to test the effect of treatment with a sustained-release ivermectin bolus on average daily and total weight gain in breeding age Holstein heifers under commercial pasture conditions in southern Quebec. One hundred and twelve heifers from 12 herds were randomly assigned at turnout either to treatment with a commercially-available ivermectin bolus or to remain as untreated controls. Ninety-six heifers, 49 treated animals and 47 controls, completed the trial. Animals were weighed at turnout, midseason, and at the end of the grazing season. Fecal samples were collected at each of these times and nematode eggs counted. Nematode egg excretion was relatively low throughout the pasture season, which was abnormally warm and dry until midsummer. Over the entire pasture season, average daily weight gain was higher in treated than in control animals (difference = 0.08 kg/day, P = 0.010). Total weight gain was also higher in treated animals than in control animals (difference = 12.82 kg, P = 0.013). The results of this study suggest that preventive treatment of breeding age, grazing dairy heifers with a sustained-release ivermectin bolus provides a significant weight gain advantage, in situations with moderate utilization of moderately contaminated pastures.",

    "abstract": "Comment in    J R Soc Med. 1994 Mar;87(3):183.An open, randomized, parallel group study of three different aspirin preparations was carried out. The objective of this study was to compare their ability to inhibit the production of thromboxane A2 (measured as thromboxane B2 [TXB2]) from platelets. Three aspirin preparations were studied: Acetard 300 mg, Acetard 100 mg and Platet 100 mg. The study was conducted in 45 healthy adult volunteers and treatment continued once daily for 7 days. The results of the TXB2 assay show that the administration of all three treatment preparations produced a rapid drop in TXB2 levels of all volunteers. The baseline TXB2 level was reduced by 95% for all groups by day 3. Analysis by day showed a significant difference (P < 0.05) between treatments at day 1, with Acetard 100 mg having higher TXB2 levels than the other two groups. Analysis of changes from baseline showed a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in TXB2 levels at Days 1 to 14 for all three groups. Platelet aggregation also showed a significant reduction, being reduced to 10% of control at 7 days. It then reverted back to baseline by 28 days for all treatment groups. In conclusion, low dose aspirin is very effective as an antiplatelet agent and in a slow release form loses none of its patency.",

Healthy male volunteers were given sustained release theophylline (300 mg) along with 300 ml of either water or GFJ. Blood samples (2 ml) were collected at different time points from 0 to 48 h. Plasma was assayed for theophylline by HPLC and various pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Theophylline levels were lower at all time points with GFJ coadministration as compared to water but were significantly lower only during the absorption phase from 1 to 4 h. Although the pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different between the two groups, all values were reduced except Tmax which was slightly increased. The results indicate that patients may be advised not to consume GFJ when taking slow-release theophylline and monitoring of plasma theophylline levels in patients consuming GFJ might be helpful in better management of patient care.",

Since marked effects can be achieved with the inhaled route, more information is needed about the dosing characteristics of all available inhalers. As there are now two multidose powder inhalers available in the U.K. capable of supplying 1 month or more of treatment, this study was designed to compare the delivery characteristics of these two dry powder inhalers delivering glucocorticosteroids. The method used was in vitro analysis of the emitted dose and fine particle fraction throughout the life of five of each type of device. The multidose powder inhaler delivered between 87 and 93% of the label claim dosage, whilst the reservoir device delivered 40-58%. There was no fall off of shot potency towards the end of either device's life. Fine particle fraction for the multidose and reservoir systems, was 21 and 18%, respectively, at 60 l min-1 flow, but fell to 16 and 6% at 28.3 l min-1. In conclusion, there were statistically significant differences (P < 0.0001) in the drug emission of both dose and fine particle fraction of these two powder inhalers.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reversibility after administration of an inhaled bronchodilator is not always demonstrable in patients with asthma. Bronchodilator aerosol-induced bronchoconstriction has also been reported to occur in some patients.METHODS: Fifteen selected patients showing < 10% improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) when tested with four doses of salbutamol (0.1 mg/dose) or terbutaline (0.25 mg/dose) from a pressurised metered dose inhaler (MDI) participated in two randomised, double blind studies. They received 2.0 mg terbutaline (4 x 2 doses of 0.25 mg) or a corresponding placebo from an MDI connected to a 750 ml spacer, and 1.0 mg (2 x 0.5 mg) terbutaline or placebo from a multidose dry powder inhaler free of additives (Turbohaler).RESULTS: Inhalation of placebo MDI resulted in a mean (SD) decrease in FEV1 of 20.5 (14.1)% (range -42.9% to +2.6%). In 14 patients inhalation of 2.0 mg terbutaline MDI with spacer resulted in < 10% improvement (mean increase 3.1 (6.0)%). One mg of terbutaline via a Turbohaler resulted in improvements in FEV1 of > 15% in eight patients (mean increase 16.0 (9.7)%). The improvement was < 10% in four patients. Use of placebo Turbohaler did not affect airway calibre (mean change 0.2 (2.9)%).CONCLUSIONS: Additives of MDIs may cause bronchoconstriction in some patients with asthma. In these patients inhalation from a pressurised metered dose inhaler is more likely to decrease the bronchodilator response than inhalation from an additive-free inhaler. The frequency of this phenomenon is unknown.",

    "title": "Influence of inspiratory capacity on bronchodilatation via Turbuhaler or pressurized metered-dose inhaler in asthmatic children: a comparison.",
    "abstract": "This study was designed to compare the bronchodilatatory effect of terbutaline inhaled through Turbuhaler (TH) or pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) in young asthmatics, and to assess the possible relationship between patients' inspiratory capacity and bronchodilatation for both devices. One hundred and eighteen asthmatics (aged 4 10/12-20 6/12 years) with bronchial obstruction (mean Vmax 50%: 59.5% pred, SD 17.8% pred) were allocated at random to two groups of 59 patients to inhale 0.5 mg terbutaline either by TH or by pMDI (and placebo by dummy of the other device). In- and expiratory spirometry and bodyplethysmography were conducted before and 10 min after inhalation. Bronchodilatation was effective [change in airways resistance (delta RAW) -50%, change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (delta FEV1)+15%, delta Vmax 50% or 25% + 25% of baseline] in 41 of 59 patients with pMDI (69.5%) and 33 of 59 patients with TH (55.9%). The effect on Vmax 50% was significantly better with pMDI than with TH. Turbuhaler users with higher inspiratory flow [forced inspiratory volume in 1 s (FIV1), forced inspiratory flow at 50% vital capacity (FIF50)] reached better bronchodilatation, while bronchodilatatory effect was not correlated with inspiratory performance in MDI users. Peak inspiratory flow (PIF) did not correlate well with bronchodilatation by TH. When using TH for bronchodilatation, the effectiveness of terbutaline depends upon the degree of inspiratory capacity. This can lead to impaired bronchodilatatory effect in subgroups of obstructive young asthmatics with low inspiratory flow. In contrast, when using a pMDI, inspiratory capacity does not seem to influence the effectiveness of terbutaline.",

BMJ. 2001 Jul 7;323(7303):50.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether elderly people can learn to use the inhaler used to deliver zanamivir (Relenza Diskhaler) as effectively as the Turbohaler and to identify which aspects of inhaler technique are most problematic.DESIGN: Randomised, controlled, intervention study.SETTING: Wards for acute elderly care in a large district general hospital.PARTICIPANTS: 73 patients who were unfamiliar with the use of an inhaler, aged 71 to 99 (mean 83) years.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Initial scores and changes in scores 24 hours later using a 10 point scoring system of five aspects of inhaler technique.RESULTS: 38 patients were allocated the Relenza Diskhaler and 35 the Turbohaler. The mean total score was significantly greater in the Turbohaler than Diskhaler groups both initially (8.74 v 7.05) and after 24 hours (8.28 v 5.43). The major difference between inhalers was in loading and priming. After tuition 50% (19 of 38) of patients allocated the Diskhaler were unable to load and prime the device and 65% (24 of 37) were unable to do so 24 hours later. Of those allocated the Turbohaler, two patients were unable to load and prime the device after initial review and one after 24 hours.CONCLUSION: Most elderly people cannot use the inhaler device used to deliver the anti-influenza drug zanamivir. Treatment with this drug is unlikely to be effective in elderly people unless the delivery system is improved.",

The LSM was developed from a training data set of 15 subjects using one blood sample taken at 48 h following a single dose. The model was validated on 60 subjects who received different doses of CBZ. Following multiple dosing, the LSM was developed from a training data set of 10 subjects using the steady state Cmin (plasma concentration obtained 5 min before the last CBZ-SR dose).RESULTS: The model provided good estimates of AUC and Cmax for CBZ and CBZE. The bias and the precision of the predicted AUC and Cmax for CBZ and CBZE were less than 10% and 15%, respectively. Similar results were obtained when CBZ was given as multiple dose.CONCLUSIONS: The method described here may be used to estimate AUC and Cmax for CBZ and CBZE without detailed pharmacokinetic studies following single or multiple dose of CBZ.",

    "title": "The effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine in two slow release formulations: pronounced lag-time after a high fat breakfast.",
    "abstract": "AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of concomitant food intake on the bioavailability of two nifedipine containing modified release dosage forms for once daily administration. The clinical study was performed to investigate the in vivo relevance of pH-dependent differences in the in vitro release properties of the two dosage forms.METHODS: This was a randomized, open, 4-way crossover study in 24 healthy, male subjects. Following an overnight fast of 12 h single doses of Adalat OROS or Slofedipine XL were administered either in the fasted state or immediately after a high fat American breakfast. Nifedipine plasma concentrations in samples obtained until 48 h after drug administration were determined using a validated LC-MS/MS method. Calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters was conducted model-independently. The two dosage forms as well as the two administration conditions were compared by calculating point estimates and 90% confidence intervals for the relevant pharmacokinetic parameters. In vitro dissolution tests were performed using a paddle apparatus 3 acc. USP, a pharmacopoeial dissolution system consisting of reciprocating cylinders in flat-bottomed glass vessels, with various buffer systems covering the entire physiological pH-range of the gastrointestinal tract.RESULTS: After fasted administration the extent of bioavailability of nifedipine as characterized by AUC(0,infinity) was slightly lower for Slofedipine XL compared with Adalat OROS with a point estimate of 82.3% primarily resulting from pronounced differences in nifedipine concentrations during the first 15 h after administration. Accordingly, maximum plasma concentrations were lower after administration of Slofedipine XL compared with Adalat OROS (point estimate: 84.3%). Under fed conditions the differences in bioavailability between the two products as characterized by the pharmacokinetic parameters AUC(0,tn) and Cmax were greater than after fasting conditions with point estimates of 69.6% and 81.0%, respectively. However, most striking was a pronounced delay in nifedipine absorption observed under fed conditions after administration of Slofedipine XL which resulted in lag-times of more than 15 h in 15 out of 24 subjects. Owing to this lag-time under fed conditions the relative bioavailability of nifedipine from Slofedipine XL compared with Adalat OROS was only 28% over the intended dosing interval of 24 h.CONCLUSIONS: In this study a dosage form-dependent food interaction was observed which, under fed conditions, resulted in pronounced differences in the relative bioavailability of nifedipine between Slofedipine XL and Adalat OROS over the intended dosing interval of 24 h. The delay in nifedipine absorption when Slofedipine XL is administered after a high-fat breakfast may be explained by the formulation properties. Slofedipine XL is an erosive tablet with an acid resistant coating whereas Adalat OROS is designed with an osmotic push-pull system. Under fed conditions drug from the single unit enteric coated dosage form exhibits a delayed absorption probably due to an extensively prolonged gastric residence time which does not allow drug release, on the other hand the osmotically driven push-pull system is not sensitive to concomitant food intake. The observed phenomenon might be of therapeutic relevance. For example a change from taking Slofedipine XL in the fed to the fasted state might result in increased systemic concentrations of nifedipine.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether pituitary desensitization with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a), buserelin acetate, before the administration of human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) for ovarian stimulation in in vitro fertilization (IVF) is superior to the simultaneous administration of both hormones at the beginning of the treatment cycle.DESIGN: Prospective randomized study.PATIENTS: Ninety-one patients having their first attempt at IVF.INTERVENTIONS: Patients in group 1 (long protocol) were administered subcutaneous (SC) buserelin acetate 200 micrograms/d from day 1 of the menstrual cycle, and hMG was started only after pituitary desensitization had been achieved at least 14 days later. Patients in group 2 (short protocol) were administered SC buserelin acetate 200 micrograms/d from day 2 and the same dose of hMG used in the long protocol from day 3 of the menstrual cycle.RESULTS: The median total amount of hMG required in both groups was comparable. There were significantly more follicles (P = 0.0001), oocytes (P = 0.0008), fertilized oocytes (P = 0.0001), and cleaved embryos (P = 0.0001), and a higher fertilization rate (P = 0.0047) in patients in group 1. The pregnancy rates per initiated cycle and per embryo transfer were 19.57% and 25.71% in group 1 compared with 8.89% and 16.67% in group 2.CONCLUSIONS: The long protocol is superior in terms of significantly greater follicular recruitment, oocyte recovery and fertilization rates, and significantly greater number of embryos available for transfer. In general, it is the preferred method when GnRH-a are used for ovarian stimulation in IVF.",

I.v. insulin infusion was done on 14 diabetics for 24 hr using the algorithm, and blood glucose was controlled within the proper range in all cases; mean blood glucose was 130 +/- 42 mg/100 ml. During the examination, 4 of 14 cases did not need insulin infusion from midnight to the morning (type A) and 7 cases needed insulin infusion from midnight to the morning (type B). In 3 cases, insulin infusion was not needed at midnight, but blood glucose rose markedly in the early morning followed by insulin infusion (type C). The insulin regimen was determined according to the amount of insulin infused during the examination, dividing insulin dosages into two separate doses using semilente in the morning and a mixture of regular and lente insulin in the evening. In all the cases of type A and B, blood glucose was controlled well on the calculated regimen of insulin. However, good control of blood glucose was not obtained in 3 diabetics of type C. It is concluded that the algorithm is reliable in the estimation of the insulin infusion rate to control blood glucose in the diabetics, and the insulin regimen calculated from the result of intravenous insulin infusion is proper in about 78% of the diabetics.",

In study 1 (n = 10), each infant was given 200 micrograms of salbutamol at 4 hour intervals and in random sequence from a metered dose inhaler-spacer device, a jet nebuliser, and an ultrasonic nebuliser with a small medication cup. The infants were monitored for heart rate, transcutaneous pO2, pCO2, and oxygen saturation, respiratory system resistance and compliance before and after each treatment. Infants in study 2 (n = 10) were similarly studied except for the use of a different jet nebuliser.RESULTS: The mean (SEM) maximum percentage decreases in respiratory system resistance, observed at 30 minutes after aerosol delivery were study 1: MDI: 44.3 (4.3)%; jet: 32.3 (3.4)%; ultrasonic: 56.1 (3.2)%; study 2: MDI: 28.6 (1.0)%; jet: 16.9 (1.4)%; ultrasonic: 42.1 (1.6)%. During the first hour after treatment, a significantly faster heart rate and higher transcutaneous pO2 were associated with the use of the ultrasonic nebuliser or MDI than with the jet nebulisers in both studies. The use of the ultrasonic nebuliser but not the other devices also resulted in a lower transcutaneous pCO2 and improved respiratory system compliance in study 2.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that among the devices tested, the delivery of salbutamol aerosol to the lower respiratory tract was greatest using the ultrasonic nebuliser, and least with the jet nebulisers.",

    "abstract": "Polyethylene glycol-conjugated adenosine deaminase (pegademase) is used for enzyme replacement therapy for patients with severe combined immunodeficiency caused by adenosine deaminase deficiency. The entrapment of pegademase within human energy-replete carrier erythrocytes using a hypo-osmotic dialysis procedure was investigated with the objective of prolonging the in vivo circulatory half-life of the enzyme and maintaining therapeutic blood levels. Native unmodified adenosine deaminase (ADA) was similarly studied. The efficiency of pegademase entrapment was low (9%) whereas the entrapment of native unmodified ADA was substantial (50%), suggesting that the polyethylene glycol side-chains were impeding intracellular entrapment. The biochemical characteristics and the osmotic fragility of these carrier erythrocytes were not adversely affected by the entrapment of either pegademase or native ADA. In vivo survival studies of pegademase-loaded 51Cr-labelled carrier erythrocytes in an ADA-deficient adult patient showed a mean cell half-life of 16 d. Carrier erythrocyte-entrapped pegademase and native ADA had in vivo half-lives of 20 and 12.5 d, respectively, demonstrating that entrapment prolongs the half-life over that of plasma pegademase, which has a circulating half-life of 3-6 d. These results provide the basis for a more extensive clinical evaluation of carrier erythrocyte-entrapped native adenosine deaminase therapy.",

    "title": "Single centre open study to compare patient recording of PRN salbutamol use on a daily diary card with actual use as recorded by the MDI compliance monitor.",
    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the patients' use of inhaled short acting bronchodilators as rescue therapy during a 4-week study period. In this study an electronic metered-dose inhaler compliance monitor (MDI-CM) was used to measure the time and date of actuations of the device and this information was then compared with the patients' self reporting diary card (DC). Salbutamol canisters were used in the compliance monitor. The study was approved by the local ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Patients aged 18 years and over who were either receiving, or in the investigators opinion required, inhaled salbutamol on a PRN basis were enrolled for a 4-week monitoring phase during which all rescue salbutamol used was obtained from the MDI-CM. Patients were recording their use of salbutamol in the DC each morning and evening. There was a 2-week follow-up period following completion of the monitoring phase or withdrawal from the study. Forty-four patients were enrolled and 35 patients completed the study. The mean age (range) was 43 (20-76) years and mean FEV1 2.32 (0.7-4.0) 1, with male:female ratio of 19:25. Comparison of MDI-CM and DC recordings showed patients fell into three categories: (1) patients who used rescue salbutamol appropriately and whose MDI-CM and DC recordings matched closely; (2) patients who used rescue salbutamol for acute relief but whose MDI-CM and DC recordings did not correlate and (3) patients whose use of rescue salbutamol was inappropriate or erratic according to the MDI-CM but whose DC indicated good compliance. This category of patients include those who 'dumped' all their salbutamol before attending clinic appointments. There was no significant difference in the demographic details or the severity of disease in the three groups. Recorded use of 'rescue' bronchodilator is frequently used as an indicator of efficacy for new anti-asthma therapies. This study comparing electronic data monitoring and remembered rescue salbutamol highlights the potential errors that can occur without accurate recording systems.",

    "title": "Maintaining technical quality of care in the introduction of Cyclofem in a national family planning program: findings from Indonesia.",
    "abstract": "This paper discusses the technical dimensions of \"quality of care\" in contraceptive service delivery in both the Cyclofem Introductory Trial, as well as in routine service delivery of other injectables in Indonesia. Although the quality of care in the Cyclofem trial was generally acceptable, substantial weaknesses in screening, clinical technique, the management of side-effects, and knowledge concerning re-injection time frames were identified in the provision of injectable contraceptives in routine service delivery. The findings suggest that in order for Cyclofem and other injectables to be delivered in the routine program with an adequate standard of care, considerable managerial adaptation and strengthening of providers' technical capabilities would be necessary prior to actual introduction. This would include providing training and updated technical guidelines concerning both Cyclofem and other contraceptives to providers, with an emphasis on technical issues including contraceptive indications and contraindications, re-injection time frames, maintenance of asepsis and the management of side-effects. Strengthening the existing management information system and logistics systems to facilitate differentiation between injectable contraceptives provided by the program so as to ensure sufficient supplies of both contraceptives and associated materials such as needles and syringes will also be necessary.PIP: The aim was to examine the implications for service delivery in Indonesian national family planning programs introducing a new method, the injectable Cyclofem. Observations were made in 28 clinics and with in-depth interviews in Jakarta, West Java, and West Sumatra. The clinics included introductory trial clinics, nontrial health centers, community-based health posts, and private sector settings. Observations focused on the logistics of clients moving through the clinic and on all methods provided. In-depth interviews were conducted among national leaders, provincial and district program managers, public and private providers of services, community leaders, and clients. Quality of care issues focused on indications and contraindications, clinical technique, management of side effects, and appropriate follow-up in service delivery. Observations revealed that the clinical record form K-IV was not used very well for ascertaining client's needs for spacing methods. The form also did not differentiate between injectables and oral pills. Screening for contraindications was limited. Several patterns emerged on use of syringes and needles, including single use and multiple use. All used alcohol to swab the injection site, but one center reused cotton swabs. Hands were rarely washed before providing services. Many service centers were without running water in the service area. Gloves were reused without disinfection. Insertion instruments for IUDS were not properly sterilized. Written materials were only in one language. Side effects discussions were taken out of context and used to motivate clients. When symptoms were reported, complaints were dismissed, and assessment of the seriousness of bleeding or amenorrhea was not made. Clients were told to come back on a specific day. Mistiming of returns for injection resulted in mistiming of injections and a variety of inappropriate responses for assurance of contraceptive coverage. Most clients were responsible and returned on the appointed date. There were management problems that interfered with quality of care delivery: supply shortages, inadequate knowledge by staff of the importance of asepsis and technical information, heavy case loads, provider fears of discussing side effects with clients, lack of technical supervision, and general lack of attention to quality of care issues. Recommendations were to provide technical guidelines and instructions that are periodically updates, training for all service providers, written manuals or guidelines, a functional supervisory system, revision of reporting forms, refinement of logistics to assure one syringe and needle per client, and balanced staff and equipment for case load management.",

    "title": "Vascular remodeling and the local delivery of cytochalasin B after coronary angioplasty in humans.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the safety, feasibility and outcome of local delivery of cytochalasin B at the site of coronary angioplasty.BACKGROUND: Previous failures in the pharmacologic prevention of restenosis may have been related to inadequate dosing at the angioplasty site as a result of systemic drug administration. Alternatively, although previous experimental protocols have typically targeted control of excess tissue growth (intimal hyperplasia), it now appears that overall arterial constriction (vascular remodeling) is the major contributor to late lumen loss. Cytochalasin B inhibits the polymerization of actin and has proved to be a potent inhibitor of vascular remodeling in animal models.METHODS: In this phase I, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, cytochalasin B (or matching placebo) was administered to the site of a successful balloon angioplasty using a microporous local delivery infusion balloon.RESULTS: The rate of drug delivery at a constant infusion pressure varied significantly from patient to patient (range 1.7 to 20.2 ml/min), perhaps related to a variable constricting effect of the atherosclerotic plaque on the infusion balloon. The minimal stenosis diameter after the procedure was slightly better in the active drug group (1.86 +/- 0.44 vs. 1.49 +/- 0.63 mm, p < 0.03), but this difference was not seen at four to six weeks. Although the study was not powered for clinical outcomes (n = 43), the combined end point (death, nonfatal infarction or repeat revascularization) was encountered in 20% of the patients receiving cytochalasin B and in 38% of the patients receiving placebo. Clinical restenosis occurred in 18% of the treatment group and 22% of the placebo group. There were no significant differences between groups in biochemical or electrocardiographic variables.CONCLUSIONS: Cytochalasin B can be safely administered by local delivery after successful coronary angioplasty and warrants further study of its efficacy in reducing restenosis.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: To compare the lung delivery of salbutamol from a commonly used constant output open vent jet nebuliser (Sidestream) with use of both a conventional large volume plastic spacer (Volumatic) and a novel small volume metal spacer (NebuChamber). This was assessed using the early lung absorption profile of salbutamol over the first 20 min after inhalation.METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers were studied in a randomized single (investigator) blind crossover design. Single 1200 microg nominal doses salbutamol from a CFC-free metered-dose inhaler (12 sequential 100 microg puffs of Airomir) were delivered via the Volumatic and NebuChamber spacers. A single 1200 microg nominal dose of salbutamol was given as a 4 ml fill volume from a Sidestream nebuliser with mouthpiece. Mouth rinsing was performed after each drug sequence. Plasma salbutamol was measured at 5, 10, 15 and 20 min after the last dose of each inhalation sequence, with calculation of maximal concentration (Cmax) and average concentration over 20 min (C[av]). Systemic beta2-responses were measured as plasma potassium, tremor and heart rate.RESULTS: Both the Volumatic and the NebuChamber spacers produced significantly greater salbutamol concentration than the Sidestream nebuliser. For C(av) this amounted to a 7.34-fold difference (95%CI 5.31 to 9.38) between Volumatic vs Sidestream, and a 7.04-fold difference (95%CI 4.91 to 9.17) for NebuChamber vs Sidestream. Similar differences were found for the extrapulmonary beta2-responses. There were no significant differences in either salbutamol concentration or extrapulmonary beta2-responses between the Volumatic and NebuChamber spacers.CONCLUSIONS: We found that, in vivo, both the Volumatic and the NebuChamber spacers produced seven-fold greater lung delivery of salbutamol than the Sidestream nebuliser when comparing microgram equivalent nominal doses, in terms of the early lung absorption profile.",

    "title": "Nebuliser performance, pharmacokinetics, airways and systemic effects of salbutamol given via a novel nebuliser delivery system (\"Ventstream\").",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Currently available nebulisers are inefficient and show variable aerosol deposition in the lung owing to the differences in the particle size generated. The aim of this study was to compare systemic absorption and bronchodilator effects of salbutamol given via a novel (\"Ventstream\") and a conventional (\"Hudson Updraft II\") nebuliser system, having initially evaluated the performance of both nebulisers in vitro. The \"Ventstream\" nebuliser uses a one way valve system to provide an additional inspiratory side flow to match aerosol delivery with tidal volume.METHODS: Nebuliser output and particle distribution from 10 Ventstream and 10 Hudson nebulisers were compared in vitro. Eight asthmatic patients, FEV1 55(2)% predicted, were then randomised to receive salbutamol via Ventstream or Hudson nebulisers on separate days. On each day cumulative doses of inhaled salbutamol were given: 1.25 mg, 2.5 mg (1.25 + 1.25 mg), and 5.0 mg (2.5 + 2.5 mg). Airways responses, systemic responses, and plasma salbutamol concentrations were measured at each dose and for up to 240 minutes after the final dose.RESULTS: The in vitro comparison showed a greater respirable fraction with a higher percentage volume of particles < 5 microns in diameter using Ventstream than Hudson nebulisers (mean (95% CI) for difference): 25.4% (95% CI 22.4% to 28.3%), and a higher aerosol rate of output: 0.08 g/min (95% CI 0.05 to 0.11 g/min). At the 5.0 mg dose the Ventstream produced a twofold greater concentration of plasma salbutamol than the Hudson nebuliser (AUC0-240): 392.1 ng/ml.min (95% CI 240.6 to 543.6 ng/ml.min). There was a higher AUC0-240 for PEFR with the Ventstream than with the Hudson nebuliser: 74.161 x 10(2) (95% CI 39.50 to 108.821 x 10(2). For FEV1 and FEV25-75 there was a difference in the peak response between the 5.0 mg and 2.5 mg doses with the Ventstream only. Extrapulmonary beta 2 responses were greater with the Ventstream than with the Hudson at 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg doses, although the differences did not appear to be clinically relevant.CONCLUSIONS: The Ventstream produced a twofold increase in the delivery of salbutamol to the lung compared with the Hudson nebuliser, and there was an associated increase in systemic beta 2 responses with an improvement in some parameters of bronchodilator efficacy. As a consequence of improved delivery with the Ventstream, it may be possible to halve the drug dose to produce similar bronchodilator efficacy at reduced cost. Further studies are required to evaluate the value of the Ventstream for delivery of nebulised antibiotics and corticosteroids.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current guidelines on the treatment of childhood asthma recommend the introduction of an anti-inflammatory drug in children who have persistent symptoms and require regular treatment with a bronchodilator. The efficacy and safety of inhaled nedocromil sodium (Tilade Mint aerosol) administered using a Fisonair spacer at a dose of 4 mg three times daily was compared with placebo in the treatment of asthmatic children aged 6-12 years who are symptomatic and recovering from an acute exacerbation of asthma.METHODS: A group comparative, double blind, placebo controlled trial was performed in children who were recovering from an acute episode of asthma following treatment in the emergency department of the hospital or in children referred from their general practitioner following a wheezing episode and documented evidence of at least two previous episodes of wheezing. A two week baseline period on existing bronchodilator treatment was followed by a 12 week treatment period on either nedocromil sodium (2 mg/puff) or placebo. Both treatments were administered using a Fisonair spacer at a dose of two puffs three times daily. Changes from baseline values in daytime asthma and night time asthma symptom scores, usage of rescue bronchodilators, mean peak expiratory flow (PEF) recorded twice daily on diary cards, patients' opinion of treatment, and withdrawals due to treatment failure were measured during the primary treatment period (last six weeks of treatment).RESULTS: One hundred and forty two children aged 6-12 years entered the baseline period. Sixty three were withdrawn due to failure to meet the entry criteria (18) or the criteria for asthma symptom severity (15) or reversibility (9), because they developed uncontrolled asthma (2), because they took disallowed treatment (2), or for other non-trial related reasons (17). Seventy nine patients (46 boys) of mean age 8. 8 years entered the treatment period. There were significant differences in the changes from baseline values during the last six weeks of treatment in favour of nedocromil sodium compared with placebo in the primary variables of daytime asthma and night time asthma, morning and evening PEF, and the usage of rescue inhaled bronchodilators; 53% of patients reported nedocromil sodium to be very or moderately effective compared with 44% placebo. Improvement in asthma symptoms, PEF, and reduction in use of rescue bronchodilators did not reach statistical significance until after six weeks of treatment. Twenty two patients were withdrawn or dropped out during the treatment phase, 12 due to uncontrolled asthma or persistence of asthma symptoms, four due to suspected adverse drug reactions (nedocromil sodium 3 (headaches 2, angio-oedema/urticaria 1), placebo 1(persistent cough)), and six due to non-treatment related reasons. Seventy one adverse events were reported by 27 patients in the nedocromil group and 75 by 30 patients in the placebo group.CONCLUSIONS: Asthma symptoms, use of bronchodilators, and lung function can be improved significantly in children recovering from an acute exacerbation of asthma or wheeze and currently receiving treatment with bronchodilators alone by the addition of inhaled nedocromil sodium at a dose of 4 mg three times daily administered using a Fisonair holding chamber.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy and tolerability of fluticasone propionate (FP) 2 mg daily via a metered-dose inhaler and Volumatic (Glaxo Wellcome) spacer device was compared with nebulized budesonide (nBUD), 2 and 4 mg daily, in a multi-centre, open-label, cross-over study of adult asthmatics. Patients received, in random order, either 4 weeks of treatment with FP followed by 4 weeks of treatment with nBUD, or vice versa, with an intervening 4 week 'wash-out' period between treatments. Thirty patients completed the study, of whom 24 were evaluable. In terms of the primary efficacy parameter, change in mean morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) (l min-1) from baseline to the fourth week of each treatment period, FP was more effective than nBUD [mean difference (FP-nBUD) 21.1 l min-1, P = 0.007, 95% CI (6.5, 35.7)]. Sub-group analysis demonstrated FP to be superior to the 4 mg nBUD [mean treatment difference (FP-nBUD) 42.9 l min-1, P = 0.026, 95% CI (7.1, 78.8)] and at least as efficacious as the 2 mg nBUD sub-group [mean treatment difference (FP-nBUD) 10.2 l min-1, P = 0.211, 95% CI (-6.5, 26.9)]. Furthermore, larger reductions in diurnal variation were observed during FP treatment [mean treatment difference (FP-nBUD) -4.4 percentage points, P = 0.028, 95% CI (-8.4, -0.5)]. There was no significant difference between the treatments for the proportion of symptom-free 24 h periods. Of those expressing a preference, significantly more patients found FP via a metered-dose inhaler and spacer device both easier to administer (78%, P = 0.007) and more convenient to take (76%, P = 0.008) than nebulized budesonide. In addition, cost per patient analysis showed that nebulized budesonide was from 1.7 to 3.5 times more expensive than FP.",

    "abstract": "Sustained-release morphine (SRM) was studied in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related chronic pain. Outpatients and inpatients with AIDS-related pain were studied for 3-18 days in an open-label prospective survey. Patients were stratified according to prior opioid analgesic use for the purposes of initiating and titrating SRM, which was administered at a 12-hr interval. Immediate-release morphine (IRM) was offered every 2 hr as needed for supplemental analgesia at one-quarter to one-third of the 12-hourly SRM dose. Pain intensity (PI), quality of life (QL), acceptability of therapy (AT), side effects, safety, and morphine usage were evaluated. Of 44 patients enrolled, 40 (91%) were evaluable for intent-to-treat analysis, and 24 (55%) completed the study. PI decreased by 50% (from severe to mild-moderate) in the intent-to-treat patients and by 65% (from severe to mild) in the completed patients. QL was fair to good in 80% and poor in 20% of both groups. AT was good to excellent in 78% of the intent-to-treat and in 96% of the completed patients. Of 61 adverse events reported, 61% required intervention, and 92% were resolved. Total morphine dose remained stable while IRM dosage and frequency of use significantly decreased with escalation of the SRM dose. A significant reduction in PI was achievable with SRM in a variety of painful conditions experienced by AIDS patients, with limited or manageable side effects in most. This study supports the usefulness of opioid analgesia for severe pain in AIDS.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study compared exercise and pharmacologic stress testing using arbutamine delivered by a closed-loop device for the detection of coronary artery disease.BACKGROUND: Arbutamine, an agent designed to simulate exercise, has been developed in conjunction with a closed-loop delivery device that modulates the rate of administration on the basis of physiologic feedback.METHODS: Two hundred ten patients (180 men, 30 women) with symptoms and angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease were studied. Ischemia was categorized in three ways: 1) the presence of angina; 2) the occurrence of > or = 0.1-mV horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression or elevation at 60 ms after the J point; or 3) the presence of either condition 1 or 2.RESULTS: In the 210 patients, the mean increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure evoked by arbutamine and exercise was 51 and 53 beats/min (p = NS) and 36 and 44 mm Hg (p < 0.0001), respectively. Arbutamine detected ischemia more often than exercise with each of the three ischemic end points. Sensitivity for detecting ischemia by either angina or ST segment change was 84% (95% confidence interval ¿ change was 84% (95% confidence interval [CI] 79% to 89%) for arbutamine and 75% (95% CI 69% to 81%) for exercise testing (p = 0.014). For angina alone, sensitivity was 73% (95% CI 67% to 79%) for arbutamine and 64% (95% CI 57% to 71%) for exercise (p = 0.026). For ST segment change alone, sensitivity was 47% (95% CI 40% to 54%) for arbutamine and 44% (95% CI 37% to 51%) for exercise (p = 0.426). Cardiac events occurred in five patients (1.8%) within 24 h of the arbutamine test.CONCLUSIONS: In detecting documented coronary artery disease, the sensitivity of arbutamine testing was equal to that of exercise for the electrocardiographic end point of ST segment change alone. Arbutamine testing was significantly superior to exercise testing for either ST change or angina or for angina alone.",

We evaluated the role of chronic opioid therapy in four such patients. The patients (mean age 79.5 years) were treated by low doses (mean 40 mg/day) of controlled-release oral morphine (CRM) for 1 to 5 years. The treatment was followed by a marked decline in the rate of admissions and hospitalization periods. The number of admissions decreased from a mean of 6 during the year prior to CRM therapy to 1.5 the following year. The duration of hospitalization for angina pectoris during these periods decreased from a mean of 42 +/- 35 days to 6 +/- 10 days (p < 0.05). Side effects were negligible and consisted mainly of lactulose-responsive constipation. We suggest that prolonged oral morphine therapy may be administered with good efficacy and no significant side effects in selected patients with intractable angina pectoris.",

    "title": "[A practical study of the efficacy of a delayed-action preparation of carbamazepine (Tegretol CR 400) in the treatment of patients with partial epilepsy ].",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Carbamazepine (CBZ) is the first choice antiepileptic drug in the treatment of partial seizures. Many clinical studies show high efficacy and good tolerance of CBZ in the majority of patients. However, poor water solubility and erratic absorption as well as autoinduction of its metabolism, cause wide and unpredictable fluctuations in CBZ serum concentration. In order to avoid these problems controlled-release formulations of CBZ (Tegretol CR 400) were developed.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, tolerance and practicality of the therapy of partial seizures in adults with controlled-release CBZ (Tegretol CR 400).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a three-year period we conducted an open pragmatic study of controlled-release CBZ in the therapy of 141 adult patients with established diagnosis of localized related epilepsy. Patients with progressive brain or systemic disease were excluded. All patients had unacceptable seizure frequency and were divided into four groups: 1) 34 with newly-diagnosed epilepsy; 2) 42 with chronic epilepsy and no previous antiepileptic medication; 3) 27 with chronic epilepsy previously treated with conventional preparations of carbamazepine (CBZ); and 4) 38 with chronic epilepsy previously treated with other antiepileptic medications. Patients were switched to controlled-release CBZ and the dosage was slowly adjusted. Baseline evaluation included the analysis of efficacy, tolerance and practicality of the controlled-release CBZ therapy. Three categories of efficiency were defined: 1) successful (patients without seizures); 2) partially successful (patients with improvement of at least 50% in frequency and severity of seizures); and 3) unsuccessful therapy (same or worse than before controlled-release CBZ). Tolerance and practicity were evaluated through the analysis of side effects and frequency of daily doses, respectively. These variables were compared to the corresponding ones after a period of at least three months of full dosage controlled-release CBZ therapy.RESULTS: In all four groups the therapy was successful in 76%, 52%, 30% and 29%, partially successful in 18%, 43%, 30% and 32%, and unsuccessful in 6%, S%, 40% and 39%, respectfully. Side effects occurred less frequently in all 4 groups during the therapy with controlled-release CBZ. We found reduced frequency of drug administration (once or twice daily) in 97.9% of our patients.DISCUSSION: Due to its slow and irregular absorption, short half life, wide and unpredictable fluctuation in plasma levels CBZ has decreased ability to control seizures, with the appearance of the intermittent side-effects such as diplopia, ataxia, headache and dizziness. Controlled-release formulation of CBZ sustains stable absorption and reduces fluctuations in carbamazepine serum concentration. Steady serum levels permit to the majority of patients to tolerate a higher total daily dose by reducing peak-dependent side-effects and improve compliance as a result of less frequent daily doses (1 or 2).CONCLUSION: In patients with partial seizures controlled-release vs. conventional carbamazepine had better efficiency, based on an excellent tolerance, favorable daily dosage and superior compliance.",

    "abstract": "The Nifedipine Gastro-Intestinal Therapeutic System (GITS) Circadian Anti-ischemia Program (N-CAP) was designed to test the effect of nifedipine GITS as monotherapy or in combination with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent on the circadian pattern of angina and silent ischemia in patients with chronic stable angina. At 118 sites in the United States, 1,174 patients were screened for entry into this study. To be eligible for participation patients were required to have at least two episodes of angina a week and at least two episodes of myocardial ischemia during 48-h ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring during the baseline placebo period. A total of 207 patients completed all phases of the study. Beta-blockers were continued in those patients already receiving them. In this 7- to 10-week single-blind placebo withdrawal study, a 1-week placebo run-in was followed by up to 5 weeks of single-blind titration with nifedipine GITS, a 4-week efficacy phase with an established dose and a final single-blind 2-week placebo withdrawal period. Ambulatory ECG monitoring was performed at the end of each placebo phase and at the end of the efficacy phase with a digital monitoring device that was validated in a pilot study. Overall, nifedipine GITS significantly reduced the weekly number of anginal episodes from 5.7 to 1.8 (p = 0.0001) and the number of ischemic events from 7.3 to 4 (p = 0.0001) reported during the 48-h monitoring periods, with a significant increase in both during the placebo withdrawal period. The baseline circadian pattern of ischemia showed an early morning peak and a secondary peak in the afternoon. Nifedipine GITS significantly reduced ischemia during the 48-h period when administered as monotherapy or in combination with a beta-blocker. Patients were also randomized to receive nifedipine GITS in either a morning or an evening dose. The two regimens resulted in equal anti-ischemic benefit. The primary side effect of nifedipine GITS was edema, which was dose related. In summary, nifedipine GITS reduced the number of anginal and ischemic episodes when given alone or in combination with a beta-blocker. Nifedipine GITS had a sustained effect: a single daily dose was effective over 24 h regardless of whether it was administered in the morning or evening. This study also suggests that combination therapy with nifedipine GITS and a beta-blocker is especially efficacious in reducing ischemia.",

Blood bST antibodies developed within the first 7 wk of treatment, and the number of cows with anti-bST binding generally declined with time. Thirteen out of 59 cows receiving bST developed binding activity > 25% (positives) during the 1st yr. At the .6-g dose level, no binding was detected after wk 15. Seven of the 13 positive cows were among the group randomly selected to continue on study during yr 2. In the 2nd yr, only 2 out of 24 bST-treated cows were positive. Binding activity was associated with the IgG fraction in serum. Binding capacities of antibodies ranged from .625 to 3.04 mg of bST/L, and affinities ranged from 1.14 x 10(8) to 3.14 x 10(8) L/mol. Cows considered to be clinically positive had performance similar to those of their herdmates having binding < 25%. No evidence of a pathologic effect of antibodies existed in treated cows, their calves, or fetuses.

The predicted and measured reductions in blood pressure during steady state nifedipine treatment were compared for the trough and peak responses and there was reasonable agreement for the group of patients as a whole. However, when the measured and predicted blood pressure profiles were compared for each individual patient there was close agreement for the majority of patients but there were significant discrepancies in a few cases. Further analysis of the steady state concentrations in these cases revealed that there was no change in their responsiveness to nifedipine and that discrepancies were directly attributable to inappropriate compliance with the drug regimen. The analysis was further extended to simulate the blood pressure responses to alternative fixed dosage regimens. Assessment of these simulations suggests that blood pressure control with nifedipine Retard is significantly improved by three times daily drug administration.",

Twelve healthy nonsmokers were randomly assigned a single dose of the following treatments at weekly intervals: Theo-Dur, Theo-24 or Xanthium orally, or aminophylline intravenously. Serially collected serum samples were analyzed for theophylline with use of fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA). All three SRT preparations showed reliable absorption characteristics, but Theo-Dur had a shorter Tmax and MRT and a higher Ka. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of Theo-24 and Xanthium were similar except that Xanthium had lower bioavailability. Using single dose data for simulation of steady state pharmacokinetics, we found that a once-a-day dosage regimen with either Theo-24 or Xanthium would maintain serum levels within the therapeutic range for average non-smoking young adults whereas more frequent dosing intervals with Theo-Dur would be more appropriate. Our results argue against open substitution of SRT preparations without, close monitoring of the serum theophylline concentrations when a change is made.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To assess the response rate, toxicity and survival in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma treated with liposomal daunorubicin. The study design allowed for dose escalation pending toxicity.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome, Nexstar, USA) 120 mg/m2 was administered every 21 days to a maximum of 6 cycles. Patients had to have histologically-proven malignant pleural mesothelioma. Patients were all chemotherapy-naïve with ECOG performance status 0-2.RESULTS: Fourteen patients were enrolled. There were no objective or symptomatic responses though nine patients (64%) had stable disease on therapy. Myelosuppression was the major toxicity with 9 of 11 patients evaluable for toxicity experiencing grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Other toxicities seen in at least 30% of patients included grade 3 infection and grade 2 nausea and vomiting. The median overall survival by intention-to-treat analysis was 6.1 months from the time of first treatment. The median duration of stable disease from time of first treatment for patients not progressing on therapy was 5.1 months.CONCLUSIONS: Liposomal daunorubicin 120 mg/m2 has no useful clinical activity in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Toxicity was substantial with most patients experiencing at least one episode of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Liposomal daunorubicin cannot be recommended for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.",

    "title": "Depot naltrexone: long-lasting antagonism of the effects of heroin in humans.",
    "abstract": "RATIONALE: Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, is currently approved as a treatment for heroin dependence. However, naltrexone is generally not well accepted by patients, and medication non-compliance is a difficult obstacle to treatment. A sustained-release form of naltrexone may improve compliance.OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to evaluate the time course, safety, and effectiveness of a depot formulation of naltrexone (Depotrex).METHODS: Twelve heroin-dependent individuals participated in an 8-week inpatient study. After a 1-week detoxification period, six participants received 192 mg naltrexone base and six participants received 384 mg naltrexone base. For safety, the low dose of depot naltrexone was tested before the high dose. The effects of heroin (0, 6.25, 12.5, 18.75, 25 mg, i.v.) were evaluated for the next 6 weeks. One dose of heroin was tested per day on Mondays through Fridays, and the entire dose range was tested each week. Active heroin doses were administered in ascending order during the week, while placebo could be administered on any day. Subjective, performance, and physiological effects were measured both before and after heroin administration. The hypotheses were that depot naltrexone would antagonize the effects of heroin, and that the high dose of depot naltrexone would produce a more effective and longer-lasting antagonism than the low dose.RESULTS: The low and high doses of depot naltrexone antagonized heroin-induced subjective ratings for 3 and 5 weeks, respectively. Plasma levels of naltrexone remained above 1 ng/ml for approximately 3 and 4 weeks after administration of 192 mg and 384 mg naltrexone. Other than the initial discomfort associated with the injection of depot naltrexone, there were no untoward side-effects.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that this depot formulation of naltrexone provides a safe, effective, long-lasting antagonism of the effects of heroin.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Beta-blockade usually causes a slight reduction in exercise capacity among healthy subjects, while more variable results have been observed in chronic heart failure (CHF), probably related to patients studied, methods and agent used. The effect of metoprolol controlled release/extended release (CR/XL) on peak oxygen uptake (peak VO(2)) in this patient population has not previously been investigated.AIMS: We examined the effect of long-term treatment with the selective beta(1)-receptor blocker metoprolol CR/XL once daily on exercise capacity in patients with CHF.METHODS: Ninety-four patients (70 males and 24 females; mean age 63.6+/-10.6 years) with chronic symptomatic heart failure in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-IV, and with ejection fraction <or=40%, stabilized on optimum standard therapy were randomized to metoprolol CR/XL or placebo in a double-blind trial. Exercise capacity was evaluated by peak VO(2) at baseline, after 3 months and at the end of study (mean follow-up 11.4+/-0.4 months).RESULTS: Compared with placebo metoprolol CR/XL produced a significant decrease in heart rate by 11 beats/min at rest and 18 beats/min at peak exercise. There was a tendency for a temporal decline in peak VO(2) after 3 months of therapy in both groups, but altogether peak VO(2) remained unchanged from baseline with no difference between the groups at 1 year.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate to severe CHF, 11.4 months of beta(1)-blockade with metoprolol CR/XL had no effect on exercise capacity when compared with placebo or baseline.",

    "title": "Randomized evaluation of controlled-release codeine and placebo in chronic cancer pain.",
    "abstract": "Codeine is widely used in combination with acetaminophen and aspirin for the management of mild to moderate pain. However, there are few controlled clinical trials of single-entity codeine in chronic cancer pain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of controlled-release codeine given every 12 hr in patients with cancer pain. Thirty-five patients with chronic cancer pain were randomized in a double-blind crossover study to controlled-release (CR) codeine or placebo, for 7 days each. Pain intensity was assessed at 0800 hr and 2000 hr using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a five-point categorical scale, and the use of \"rescue\" acetaminophen-plus-codeine (300 mg/30 mg every 4 hr as needed) was recorded. Thirty patients completed the study (17 male, 13 female; mean age, 64.4 +/- 9.8 years) with a mean daily CR codeine dose of 277 +/- 77 mg (range, 200-400 mg). CR codeine treatment resulted in significantly lower overall VAS pain intensity scores (22 +/- 18 mm versus 36 +/- 20 mm, P = 0.0001), categorical pain intensity scores (1.2 +/- 0.8 versus 1.8 +/- 0.8, P = 0.0001), and pain scores when assessed by day of treatment and by time of day. Daily \"rescue\" analgesic consumption was significantly lower on CR codeine, compared to placebo treatment (2.2 +/- 2.3 versus 4.6 +/- 2.8 tablets per day, P = 0.0001). Both patients and investigators preferred CR codeine to placebo (80% versus 3%, P = 0.0014 and 73% versus 7%, P = 0.0160, respectively). These data indicate that CR codeine, given every 12 hr results in significant reductions in pain intensity and the use of \"rescue\" acetaminophen-plus-codeine in patients with cancer pain. CR codeine provides the benefits of a flexible single entity codeine formulation and the convenience of 12-hr duration of action, which allows patients uninterrupted sleep and improved compliance.",

    "title": "Value of theophylline treatment in patients handicapped by chronic obstructive lung disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is still not certain whether it is worth using theophylline in addition to inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids to treat obstructive airways disease. This trial was designed to test whether the addition of prescribed theophylline in doses sufficient for sustained optimal steady state plasma concentrations would produce any detectable additional advantage in spirometric or functional variables in these handicapped patients.METHODS: A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover study of added theophylline treatment was aimed at steady state plasma concentrations of 10 and 17 mg/l, the dose being calculated individually by Bayesian parameter estimation and maintained for six weeks along with the patient's previously prescribed bronchodilators and steroids. Of 20 patients sequentially recruited, 15 provided data that could be analysed. All had chronic obstructive lung disease with a mean forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) up to about 30% of the predicted value and gave no history of being treated with theophylline. The protocol included spirometry, whole body plethysmography, and treadmill exercise. Measurements also included steady state plasma theophylline concentrations and trapped gas volume. Quality of life was assessed by an established questionnaire method covering breathlessness in everyday activities, fatigue, emotional function, and control over the disease.RESULTS: Both target plasma concentrations were achieved. Improvements in peak flow (PEF; mean 20%), trapped gas volumes (38%), two stage vital capacity (15%), distances walked (48%), breathlessness in everyday activities (32%), and fatigue (18%) were found at the higher plasma concentration only. FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), emotional function, and control did not change.CONCLUSION: Theophylline treatment with sustained steady state concentrations about 17 mg/l provides worthwhile objective and subjective further benefits for patients handicapped by chronic obstructive lung disease when it is added to bronchodilators and corticosteroids.",

In theory, knowledge of the entire genome of a pathogen identifies every potential drug target in any given microbe. In practice, the sheer complexity and the inadequate or inaccurate annotation of genomic information makes target identification and selection somewhat more difficult. Analysis of metabolic pathways provides a useful conceptual framework for the identification of potential drug targets and also for improving our understanding of microbial responses to nutritional, chemical and other environmental stresses. A number of metabolic databases are available as tools for such analyses. The strengths and weaknesses of this approach are discussed.",

This double-blind study compared the efficacy and safety of K every 24 hr to K every 12 hr and MS Contin tablets (MSC) every 12 hr. One hundred fifty-two patients with cancer pain were titrated to adequate analgesia with immediate-release morphine (IRM) solution. Stabilized patients were randonized to one of the three treatments for 7 +/- 1 days. Rescue medication was IRM tablets. Efficacy and safety were assessed by time to first remedication and total dose of rescue medication, pain scores, global assessments, and incidence of morphine-related side effects. Fifty-four patients were treated with K every 24 hr. 45 with K every 12 hr. and 53 with MSC every 12 hr. Mean age was 61 years and mean total daily dose of morphine was 138 mg. Forty-six percent of the K every 24 hr patients, 51% of the K every 12 hr patients, and 55% of the MSC every 12 hr patients required rescue medication on the final day. Time to remedication was 16.0 hr for K every 24 hr, 9.1 hr for K every 12 hr and 8.7 hr for MSC every 12 hr (P = 0.0010). Patient global assessment significantly favored K every 24 hr over MSC every 12 hr (P = 0.018). There were no statistically significant differences among the treatments for any morphine-related side effects when adjusted for baseline. K had efficacy and safety profiles similar to MSC every 12 hr but had the advantage of 12- or 24-hourly administration.",

Morning dipping, assessed by the fall in peak flow overnight, was significantly reduced in the periods when either active drug was taken, whereas no difference was noticed during the placebo administration. No significant difference was noticed between results obtained with either active drug, as well as with either dosage of oxitropium. No subject reported side effects of oxitropium, as compared to three subjects reporting nausea, vomiting and tremors after theophylline. Oxitropium proves to be a valuable alternative to theophylline in nocturnal asthma, since it is equally potent, safer and does not require the titration of dosage.",

Both groups of patients were transferred an equal number of pre-embryos at the time of IVF. Cycles with frozen/thawed pre-embryos were evaluated based on the analysis of the three main variables that demonstrate cryopreservation efficiency: survival rate, implantation rate, and term pregnancy rate (PR).RESULTS: Non-GnRH-a group (113 transfers): pre-embryo survival, 71.5%; PR/transfer, 24.7%; implantation rate, 16.0%; GnRH-a group (125 transfers): pre-embryo survival 71.6%; PR/transfer, 32.8%; implantation rate, 12.0% (no significant differences).CONCLUSIONS: The use of GnRH-a produced pre-embryos of equal aptitude for development after cryopreservation at the pronuclear stage when compared with a similar gonadotropin stimulation treatment without GnRH-a.",

    "title": "Botulinum toxin as a carrier for oral vaccines.",
    "abstract": "Botulinum toxin is an unusually potent substance that acts on the nervous system to produce the clinical outcome of flaccid paralysis. To produce this effect, the toxin ordinarily proceeds through two separate but essential sequences of events. During the first, the toxin is ingested, it traverses a portion of the gastrointestinal system and then it is transcytosed from the lumen of the gut to the general circulation. During the second, circulating toxin binds to peripheral cholinergic nerve endings, it is endocytosed and then it acts as a metalloendoprotease to cleave polypeptides that are essential for exocytosis. Although botulinum toxin is antigenic, it ordinarily does not evoke an immune response during or after cases of oral poisoning. This is due to the fact that the dose of toxin that produces flaccid paralysis-and potentially death-is less than the dose needed to evoke an antibody response. In the recent past, the techniques of molecular biology have been used to generate an expression product of botulinum toxin that retains the ability to escape the gut and reach the general circulation, retains the ability to evoke an immune response, but has lost the ability to produce neurotoxicity. This modified toxin may have two clinical applications. The expression product itself may have utility as an oral vaccine against botulism. Beyond this, the modified toxin, or a truncation mutant of the toxin, may have utility as a carrier in the construction of other oral vaccines. Both potential applications could lead to the expression of oral vaccines in common foods.",

    "title": "Criteria to assess in vivo performance and bioequivalence of generic controlled-release formulations of carbamazepine.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Concern persists that the criteria used to establish bioequivalence of generic drugs may not adequately guarantee the interchangeability of antiepileptic medications (AEDs), particularly controlled-release (CR) formulations. We examined the utilization of several new parameters, in addition to AUC, peak plasma concentration (Cmax), and time to reach Cmax (tmax), for the assessment of bioequivalence and in vivo performance of CBZ and other CR products. These new parameters may offer additional information for evaluation of CR products that yield a prominent plateau in the plasma time-concentration curve. They include mean residence time (MRT), Cmax/AUC, plateau time or POT (the time span associated with the concentrations within 25% of Cmax), t(apical), and C(apical) (the arithmetic mean of the POT times and concentrations within 25% of Cmax, respectively). Additional parameters for multiple-dose studies include the percentage fluctuation and the flatness of the steady state-concentration curve.METHODS: These proposed parameters were used in two recent (single and multiple dose) two-way crossover studies of a new CR product of CBZ (Teril 400 CR) in comparison with Tegretol CR Divitab.RESULTS: Teril 400 CR was found to be bioequivalent to Tegretol CR Divitab, by using both the classic and the additional proposed parameters. Both CBZ CR products have similar rates of absorption and similar flatness of their plasma time-concentration curves as assessed by visual inspection and the proposed parameters.CONCLUSIONS: The additional parameters examined may supplement the traditional single-point parameters, Cmax and tmax, for assessment of rate of absorption and the flatness of the concentration curve. Their potential benefit and practical utility was confirmed in these two studies. Absorption-rate assessment is important in light of concentration-related side effects associated with CBZ therapy and the impact of fluctuations and the flatness of the CBZ plasma concentration curve on the drug efficacy and tolerability.",

Twenty-four patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and oesophageal varices were randomly assigned to receive either 160 mg C propranolol, 160 mg LA propranolol or placebo acutely and then following repeated administration (acute and chronic phases). Thereafter propranolol concentrations and beta-adrenoceptor blockade (resting and exercise heart rates) were measured at different intervals. 2. The Cmax was significantly higher with C propranolol in both phases. The time of Cmax was significantly later with LA propranolol in both phases. The AUCs were significantly higher after chronic administration with both formulations of propranolol. 3. The exercise peaks of beta-adrenoceptor blockade were similar between the two formulations and between the two phases of administration of propranolol. The duration of effective beta-adrenoceptor blockade was significantly longer in the chronic phase and seemed to be longer with LA than with C propranolol although this was not significant (72 +/- 31 vs 48 +/- 18 h, respectively). 4. There was a significant correlation between the log propranolol concentration and exercise heart rate but not with resting heart rate. No correlation could be demonstrated between pharmacological data and the Child Pugh score. 5. We conclude that in cirrhotic patients exercise testing was a reliable method in the assessment of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Pharmacology of propranolol was found to be different according to the formulation or to the phase of administration.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of batch size on the in vitro dissolution and the in vivo bioavailability of immediate release formulations of propranolol hydrochloride and metoprolol tartrate. The formulations were manufactured as small and large batches (6 kg and 60 kg for propranolol; 14 kg and 66 kg for metoprolol), and dissolution was performed using USP Apparatus I at 100 rpm and pH 1.2. Two panels of 14 subjects each were randomly assigned to receive the small and large batches of either propranolol or metoprolol in an open, randomized single-dose study. Blood samples were collected over a 24-hour (propranolol) or 18-hour (metoprolol) period and analyzed by validated methods. As determined by the f2 metric (similarity factor), the dissolution of the small and large batches of propranolol and metoprolol was similar. The mean Cmax and AUC(inf) for the small batch of propranolol were 79.0 microg/L and 536 microg/L/hr, and for the large batch they were 83.5 microg/L and 575 microg/L/hr. Cmax and AUC(inf) for the small batch of metoprolol were found to be 95.5 microg/L and 507 microg/L/hr and for the large batch, 95.1 microg/L and 495 microg/L/hr. The 90% confidence intervals for the small and large batches were within the 80% to 120% range for lnCmax, and lnAUC(inf) for both the propranolol and metoprolol formulations. These results suggest that the scale-up process does not significantly affect the bioavailability of highly soluble, highly permeable drugs and in vitro dissolution tests may be useful in predicting in vivo behavior.",

A total of 503 cows was given monensin in controlled-release capsules, and 507 were administered placebo capsules 3 wk prior to the expected calving date. The effects of treatment on milk production and milk components at the first three Dairy Herd Improvement (DHI) tests were evaluated using repeated measures analysis of variance. Treatment with monensin increased milk production, but this effect was dependent on body condition score prior to calving. Cows that were classified as thin (score of < or = 3.0) did not have increased production in response to monensin treatment. Cows with fair body condition (score of 3.25 to 3.75) produced significantly more milk at the second DHI test (+0.85 kg), but cows that were fat (score of > or = 4.0) produced significantly more milk than did controls for all three DHI tests (+1.25 kg) in early lactation. Monensin significantly increased projected 305-d milk production in cows from herds at increased risk of ketosis. Treatment with monensin had no significant effect on either milk fat percentage or milk protein percentage.",

N Engl J Med. 1993 Apr 1;328(13):959-61. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199304013281311.BACKGROUND: Characteristics such as age and race are often cited as determinants of the response of blood pressure to specific antihypertensive agents, but this clinically important issue has not been examined in sufficiently large trials, involving all standard treatments, to determine the effect of such factors.METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind study at 15 clinics, we assigned 1292 men with diastolic blood pressures of 95 to 109 mm Hg, after a placebo washout period, to receive placebo or one of six drugs: hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 50 mg per day), atenolol (25 to 100 mg per day), captopril (25 to 100 mg per day), clonidine (0.2 to 0.6 mg per day), a sustained-release preparation of diltiazem (120 to 360 mg per day), or prazosin (4 to 20 mg per day). The drug doses were titrated to a goal of less than 90 mm Hg for maximal diastolic pressure, and the patients continued to receive therapy for at least one year.RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) age of the randomized patients was 59 +/- 10 years, and 48 percent were black. The average blood pressure at base line was 152 +/- 14/99 +/- 3 mm Hg. Diltiazem therapy had the highest rate of success: 59 percent of the treated patients had reached the blood-pressure goal at the end of the titration phase and had a diastolic blood pressure of less than 95 mm Hg at one year. Atenolol was successful by this definition in 51 percent of the patients, clonidine in 50 percent, hydrochlorothiazide in 46 percent, captopril in 42 percent, and prazosin in 42 percent; all these agents were superior to placebo (success rate, 25 percent). Diltiazem ranked first for younger blacks (< 60 years) and older blacks (> or = 60 years), among whom the success rate was 64 percent, captopril for younger whites (success rate, 55 percent), and atenolol for older whites (68 percent). Drug intolerance was more frequent with clonidine (14 percent) and prazosin (12 percent) than with the other drugs.CONCLUSIONS: Among men, race and age have an important effect on the response to single-drug therapy for hypertension. In addition to cost and quality of life, these factors should be considered in the initial choice of a drug.",

    "abstract": "Serum concentrations of CA-125 were determined in association with 6-month medical (n = 48) or surgical and medical therapy (n = 40) of endometriosis. The concentration of CA-125 was significantly higher in stages III + IV (66.6 +/- 22.0 [standard deviation] U/ml) than in stage I (20.9 +/- 2.3 U/ml) or II (28.4 +/- 2.8 U/ml); in stage II, the concentration was higher than in stage I. Surgical elimination of endometriosis significantly decreased the level of CA-125, as did danazol, but not medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), although these drugs were equal in clinical efficacy. The CA-125 changes during hormonal treatment did not correlate with the clinical response. Postoperatively, CA-125 responses to danazol, MPA, or placebo did not differ significantly from each other. During the 6-month follow-up after medication, the CA-125 concentrations tended to increase, especially in danazol-treated women. The determination of CA-125 is useful in estimating the extent of the disease, but it is less valuable in monitoring the treatment effect. The ability of danazol to suppress CA-125 expression emphasizes the specific properties of this drug.",

Subjects rated their pain continuously over a 120-second period using a visual analogue scale. At 4 hours there was a significant reduction in pain in subjects who received 120 mg or 90 mg tablets compared with placebo, and in subjects who received 120 mg tablets compared with those who received 60 mg tablets.

A brief review of experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that the thrombogenicity of the injured arterial wall can be reduced by a suitable level of thermal denaturation or cross-linking of thrombogenic proteins. In addition, the concept of local pharmacologic therapy, which can be provided with laser balloon angioplasty at the site of arterial injury, is introduced. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo data suggest that guide catheter-injected albumin-heparin conjugates fabricated as water-insoluble microspheres remain adherent to the injured luminal surface and deeper arterial layers after physical trapping by the inflated balloon and subsequent laser/thermal exposure. The combination of initially adequate luminal morphology, reduction of the thrombogenicity of the injured arterial wall and application of local pharmacologic therapy with laser balloon angioplasty may eventually prove helpful in reducing the incidence of restenosis.",

As the primary function of the microvasculature is to facilitate transport between the circulation and the surrounding tissue, interactions between biomaterials and the microvasculature have been explored to understand the mechanisms controlling transport to implanted objects and ultimately improve it. This review surveys work on biomaterial-microvasculature interactions with a focus on the use of biomaterials to regulate the structure and function of the microvasculature. Several applications in which biomaterial-microvasculature interactions play a crucial role are briefly presented. These applications provide motivation and framework for a more in-depth discussion of general principles that appear to govern biomaterial-microvasculature interactions (i.e., the microarchitecture and physio-chemical properties of a biomaterial as well as the local biochemical environment).",

Presently, many different stents are available on the market, therefore most interventional cardiologist needs are well covered. Nevertheless, there are still some vessels/lesions unsuitable for coronary stenting, such as very distal lesions or lesions in small vessels. On the other hand, although restenosis is less frequent after stenting, its incidence is still significant posteriorly, representing a major health and economical problem. In the near future, new developments in stent technology such as polymeric coating, local drug delivery systems or intraarterial radiation may contribute to a further decrease in the incidence of restenosis. With better short- and long-term results indications for percutaneous coronary revascularization might be significantly expanded in the next few years.",

    "abstract": "Doxorubicin pharmacokinetics were determined in 33 patients with solid tumours who received intravenous doses of 20-320 mg m(-2) HPMA copolymer bound doxorubicin (PK1) in a phase I study. Since assay constraints limited the data at lower doses, conventional analysis was not feasible and a 'population approach' was used. Bound concentrations were best described by a biexponential model and further analyses revealed a small influence of dose or weight on V1 but no identifiable effects of age, body surface area, renal or hepatic function. The final model was: clearance (Q) 0.194 I h(-1); central compartment volume (V1) 4.48 x (1+0.00074 x dose (mg)) I; peripheral compartment volume (V2) 7.94 I; intercompartmental clearance 0.685 I h(-1). Distribution and elimination half-lives had median estimates of 2.7 h and 49 h respectively. Free doxorubicin was present at most sampling times with concentrations around 1000 times lower than bound doxorubicin values. Data were best described using a biexponential model and the following parameters were estimated: apparent clearance 180 I h-(-1); apparent V1 (I) 1450 x (1+0.0013 x dose (mg)), apparent V2 (I) 21 300 x (1-0.0013 x dose (mg)) x (1+2.95 x height (m)) and apparent Q 6950 I h(-1).

Subjects were counseled on energy-restricted diets, meal replacements, and exercise. During a 24-week extension, placebo subjects were randomized to bupropion SR 300 or 400 mg/d in a double-blinded manner.RESULTS: Of 327 subjects enrolled, 227 completed 24 weeks; 192 completed 48 weeks. Percentage losses of initial body weight for subjects completing 24 weeks were 5.0%, 7.2%, and 10.1% for placebo, bupropion SR 300, and 400 mg/d, respectively. Compared with placebo, net weight losses were 2.2% (p = 0.0468) and 5.1% (p < 0.0001) for bupropion SR 300 and 400 mg/d, respectively. The percentages of subjects who lost >or=5% of initial body weight were 46%, 59%, and 83% (p vs. placebo < 0.0001) for placebo, bupropion SR 300, and 400 mg/d, respectively; weight losses of >or=10% were 20%, 33%, and 46% (p vs. placebo = 0.0008) for placebo, bupropion SR 300, and 400 mg/d, respectively.

The adjunctive therapy with pyridostigmine was highly effective in preventing the substantial impairment in salivary flow caused by the transdermal formulation.

    "abstract": "Comment in    ACP J Club. 1998 Sep-Oct;129(2):43.BACKGROUND: Daily administration of rectal formulations of mesalazine is effective in preventing relapse of ulcerative proctitis. Maintenance of remission with lower doses would be an advantage.AIM: The efficacy of mesalazine suppositories (Pentasa) 1 g three times a week v placebo to maintain remission in patients with cryptogenetic proctitis was studied.METHODS: Ninety five patients with cryptogenetic proctitis were randomised within two weeks of remission to receive for one year or until relapse three suppositories per week of either Pentasa (n = 48) or placebo (n = 47). In the case of a relapse, the patients received one suppository/day.RESULTS: It was found that 25 of 48 subjects v 18 of 47 remained in remission in the mesalazine and placebo groups respectively. The relapse rate was lower in the mesalazine group for the following time intervals: 0-90 days (19% v 38%, p = 0.035), 0-180 days (29% v 54%, p = 0.017), 0-270 days (38% v 60%, p = 0.031), and 0-365 days (48% v 62%, p = 0.18). Treatment of relapse with one suppository/day induced remission in 11 of 18 and 2 of 26 patients in the mesalazine and placebo groups respectively (p = 0.001). Overall, 61% v 28% patients remained in the protocol and were in remission at one year (p = 0.001). Tolerance was good.CONCLUSION: Mesalazine suppositories 1 g three times a week are effective for preventing relapses of cryptogenetic proctitis. Increasing the dose to 1 g/day is effective in a high proportion of subjects who relapsed.",

Each subject ingested 75 mg/kg of either ER APAP or IR APAP and 1 week later received the other APAP preparation. On both occasions plasma APAP concentration ([APAP]) was determined 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 hours after ingestion. The times to maximum [APAP] (Tmax); the maximum [APAP] values (Cmax); the elimination half-lives 4-16 hours postingestion (t1/2), and the areas under the [APAP] vs time curve (AUC) for ER APAP and IR APAP were compared using the paired t-test.RESULTS: All the subjects completed both study phases. The mean APAP dose ingested was 5.6 g (range 4.2-7.8 g). Both the AUC and the Cmax were less after ER APAP than after IR APAP; otherwise, there was no evident difference in any measure. Graphically, ER APAP yielded a flatter, plateau-shaped curve initially, but after 4 hours the curve was nearly identical to that for IR APAP. Results are summarized in the table: [table: see text]CONCLUSION: In this model involving a single supratherapeutic dose, ER APAP evidenced no pharmacokinetic features that would suggest the need for an alternate poisoning screening strategy. When compared with IR APAP, ER APAP had a lower AUC, all peak [APAP] occurred in < 4 hours, and terminal eliminations were identical. The data suggest that, in most cases, the diagnostic approach to an overdose of ER APAP need not deviate from that used for an IR APAP overdose.",

Two hundred thirty-two patients for whom 360 degrees ALT was indicated were randomized into one of four treatment groups: 0.5% brimonidine both before and after ALT; brimonidine before but vehicle after ALT; vehicle before but brimonidine after ALT; or vehicle at both times.RESULTS: During the first 3 hours after 360 degrees ALT, the overall incidence of IOP elevations of 5 mmHg or greater was 38% (23 of 60 eyes) in the group receiving vehicle only, and it ranged from 3% to 9% (2 of 62 to 5 of 53 eyes) in the groups receiving any brimonidine treatment. There was little difference in efficacy between the three dosing regimens of brimonidine. Brimonidine was well tolerated by the patients.CONCLUSION: Based on this large, controlled, multicenter study, 0.5% brimonidine was an effective agent for reducing elevations in IOP after 360 degrees ALT. Only one dose, administered either before or after 360 degrees ALT, was required.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of GnRH analogue (GnRH-a) on the quality of frozen-thawed embryos and the pregnancy rate (PR) resulting from transfer.DESIGN: A retrospective study of two groups of women undergoing transfers of frozen-thawed embryos. In group 1 ovulation induction with hMG was begun after hypophyseal desensitization with GnRH-a for 2 weeks. In group 2 ovulation was induced with hMG only. The freezing and thawing techniques were identical for both groups.SETTING: In vitro fertilization unit at a university hospital.PATIENTS: The study group (group 1) included 108 women who underwent 137 transfer cycles of frozen-thawed embryos, and the control group (group 2) included 44 women in 51 cycles of thawed ETs.INTERVENTIONS: Ovum pick-up and ET techniques were the same for both groups. Methods of embryo freezing and thawing were identical, as were the morphological criteria for grading the embryos.RESULTS: The morphology of embryos was similar in both groups, as was the number of embryos that had at least 50% intact blastomeres (83% +/- 23% and 78% +/- 30% for group 1 and group 2, respectively). The PR (16 of 137 [11.7%] and 6 of 51 [11.8%], respectively) as well as the abortion rate (30%) were similar for both groups.CONCLUSIONS: The use of GnRH-a does not affect the quality of embryos nor the pregnancy outcome. Because the yield of frozen embryos per ovum pick-up is higher in cycles stimulated by GnRH-a/hMG, the PR per pick-up cycle is thus anticipated to be higher.",

    "title": "Effect of OROS controlled-release delivery on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oxybutynin chloride.",
    "abstract": "Aims : Dry mouth is a common side-effect seen with immediate-release oxybutynin (IR-Oxy). Ditropan XL [(Oxy-XL), a controlled-release formulation of oxybutynin chloride, is a once-daily oral dosage form that incorporates the OROS technology. Dry mouth as the pharmacodynamic measure was compared between Oxy-XL and IR-Oxy administration. The steady state stereospecific pharmacokinetics were also established for the two formulations and the kinetic-dynamic relationship of oxybutynin was examined.METHODS: This was a randomized, repeated-dose, double-blind, two-treatment, two-period, crossover study. After a baseline assessment day, volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequences and received 4 days of each treatment with a washout period of 7 days between treatments. The treatments were: 1) Oxy-XL 10 mg in the morning and placebo 8 h later, and 2) IR-Oxy 5 mg in the morning and again 8 h later. Volunteers assessed dry mouth severity subjectively using a 100 mm visual analogue scale, VAS (Baseline, treatment days 1 and 4) and objectively by collecting saliva (Baseline and treatment day 4) before dosing and every hour after the morning dose for approximately 16 h. Several blood samples were collected during each treatment, with frequent sampling on day 4 to analyse for plasma R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin concentrations.RESULTS: Relatively constant plasma concentrations of oxybutynin and its metabolite were seen over 24 h following Oxy-XL administration with the degree of fluctuation being much lower (P = 0.001; 66% to 81% reduction for the various analytes) than IR-Oxy. Compared with IR-Oxy, Oxy-XL yielded higher (131% and 158% for the R- and S-isomer, respectively) oxybutynin and lower (62% and 78% for the R- and S-isomer, respectively) desethyloxybutynin bioavailability, suggesting reduced first-pass metabolism. Saliva output (area under the effect curve) was significantly higher [P = 0.001; 37% (95% confidence interval: 24, 51%)] with Oxy-XL than with IR-Oxy and, accordingly, dry mouth severity (VAS) integrated over the day was significantly lower with Oxy-XL. The decrease in saliva output and the consequent increase in dry mouth severity correlated with the metabolite R-desethyloxybutynin concentration, and no apparent relationship was observed with the R-oxybutynin concentration. This suggests that the metabolite may contribute to the dry mouth. Therefore, the reduction in metabolite exposure with Oxy-XL may be a possible explanation for the observed decrease in dry mouth severity with OXY-XL compared with IR-Oxy.CONCLUSIONS: Oxy-XL maintains relatively constant plasma drug and metabolite concentrations and minimizes first-pass metabolism of oxybutynin. The metabolite appears to contribute to dry mouth associated with oxybutynin, and following Oxy-XL metabolite exposure is reduced compared with IR-Oxy. Consequently less dry mouth was observed with Oxy-XL as compared with IR-Oxy.",

    "title": "Genetic potential of interfacial guided osteogenesis in implant devices.",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to summarise recent advances in the design and composition of bioactive surface layers of implantabile biomaterials, and thus the genetic potential of osteoprogenitor cells to recognize and respond to these diverse implanted biomaterials. Changes applied to a biomaterial's surface, in general, could improve its biocompatibility, osseointegration and durability properties, which are required for long-term implantation in the living body. In this review, the implant-bone interface was evaluated and interpreted on the basis of osteoblast cell cultures, i.e., on the genetic potential of osteoblasts to express different phenotype markers depending on the type of biomaterials used. The interface formed by in vitro-grown osteoblasts may be used to identify components of the in vivo implant-bone interface. Over the years, a large number of implant systems consisting of many different biomaterials have been introduced in dentistry and orthopaedics. This paper discusses the performance of currently used metals and other biomaterials, by focusing on the events which occur immediately after implantation and on their impact on the bone-implant interface. The review demonstrates that continuous improvements in composition, surface modality and design of implants may benefit osseointegration and clinical longevity of such implants. No load-bearing conditions or clinical status are discussed. Titanium (Ti) and calcium phosphate ceramics are regarded as the most biocompatible synthetic substances known to be used in hard tissue implantation. These biomaterials are osteoconductive, and do not induce ectopic bone formation. Nonetheless, they provide a physical matrix which is suitable for the deposition of new bone and may guide both the growth and extension of the bone. Comparative investigation evaluated that Ti implant systems appear to be apposed by more bone than ceramic systems, although alternatives concerning the type of Ti alloy and bioactive surface layer engineering, generate extremely diverse osseointegration results. Manufacturers have created an extensive range of inorganic or ceramic coatings on Ti implants in order to achieve better bone healing and osteoconduction. Biologically active molecules, added to the implant surface, represent breakthroughs in guided interfacial osteogenesis. This methodology offers an enormous potential of genetic controlling and promoting osteogenesis. The bone growth factors are not fully understood, but most researchers agree that the contact between the bioactive surface layer of the implant and bone is not static but dynamic and that the above factors may maximise the implant osseointegration.",

    "title": "Phase II trial of topically applied miltefosine solution in patients with skin-metastasized breast cancer.",
    "abstract": "Skin deposits from breast cancer can present serious therapeutic problems, especially when resistant to conventional therapy. Topical application of a cytotoxic drug may represent an attractive new treatment modality devoid of major systemic toxicity. Miltefosine was selected because of its efficacy in breast cancer models. A mixture of alkylated glycerols of various chain lengths and water was used as the pharmaceutical vehicle to dissolve and to further facilitate tissue penetration of miltefosine. In our Institute a phase II study was performed to determine the efficacy and tolerability of topically applied miltefosine in patients with cutaneous metastases from breast cancer. Thirty-three patients in total entered the trial. A 6% miltefosine solution was applied once daily in the first week and twice daily in the following weeks. The planned minimum treatment duration was 8 weeks. We found an overall response rate of 43% for 30 evaluable patients, composed of 23% complete response and 20% partial response. The median response duration was 18 weeks, range 8-68. Toxicity consisted mainly of localized skin reactions, which could be controlled by a paraffin-based skin cream and, where appropriate, by dose modification. No systemic toxicities were observed. We conclude that topical miltefosine is an effective treatment modality in patients with skin metastases from breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical, enzymatic, and microbiologic effects of controlled-release localized administration of minocycline on dogs with periodontitis.ANIMALS: Five adult Beagles with periodontitis.PROCEDURE: After tooth scaling and root planing, 2 treatment, 1 placebo, and 1 control site were selected for each dog. Treatment sites (n = 10) received a periodontal formulation of minocycline hydrochloride, placebo sites (5) received ointment without minocycline, and control sites (5) did not receive ointment. Treatments were administered 4 times at weekly intervals. Peptidase activity and clinical and microbiologic effects were evaluated and compared among sites for 17 weeks.RESULTS: Bleeding of the gums on probing (BOP) and pocket depth (PD) improved at the treatment site and were maintained for 13 weeks after treatment. However, BOP and PD in placebo and control sites increased from weeks 9 to 17 Peptidase activity in the periodontal pocket decreased noticeably from week 1 to 17, compared with baseline values for the treatment site. However, peptidase activity for placebo and control sites increased and were above baseline values on week 9 and week 13, respectively. Total bacterial counts decreased by 90% for treatment sites and remained at that value for 13 weeks. However, for placebo and control sites, bacterial counts increased and reached the baseline value on week 17.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Increased peptidase activity is correlated with the progression of periodontitis in dogs. Treatment with minocycline, using a localized delivery system, was effective in dogs for at least 13 weeks after cessation of drug administration.",

An instrumental method, based on infrared telemetry, has been developed which obtains both distance/time measures of gait and broadness of base, as measured by foot separation at mid-swing. The latter was used as a subsidiary outcome criterion. 3. Nine patients (aged 57 to 77 years) then receiving maintenance therapy for idiopathic Parkinsonism with Sinemet CR alone, but who had previously experienced end of dose effect within 4 h of receiving a dose of a conventional formulation of levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor, were studied. 4. They received, in random order and at least 4 days apart, single doses of one tablet of Sinemet CR (200 mg levodopa/50 mg carbidopa) and of two capsules of Madopar CR (each 100 mg levodopa/25 mg benserazide), with placebo balance, at 10.00 h. Gait analysis was carried out immediately before and half-hourly for 7 h after a challenge. No routine doses of Sinemet CR were taken between 22.00 h on the night before and 17.00 h on the day of a challenge. 5. Analysis of variance showed a highly significant difference in mean stride length (P < 0.001) and in mean foot separation (P = 0.01) between serial time points, irrespective of the nature of treatment. There appeared to be a useful therapeutic response to both challenges.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of vigabatrin (VGB) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) as first-line therapy in infantile spasms.METHODS: Forty-two infants (22 males, 20 females) aged 2-9 months with newly diagnosed infantile spasms, were included in the trial. Patients were randomized to receive VGB 100-150 mg/kg/day or Depot ACTH 10 IU/day. The alternative drug was given if spasms were not controlled within 20 days or in cases of intolerance to initial therapy. Twenty-three patients (7 cryptogenic, 16 symptomatic) received VGB as first-line therapy; 19 patients (8 cryptogenic, 11 symptomatic) received ACTH as the first drug.RESULTS: Cessation of spasms was observed in 11 (48%) of the patients randomized to VGB and in 14 (74%) of those randomized to ACTH. Response to VGB was observed within 1-14 days, but two-thirds of patients (7/11) responded within 3 days. In the group treated with VGB, side effects such as drowsiness, hypotonia and irritability were observed in 13% of patients, compared with 37% in the group treated with ACTH. VGB was more effective than ACTH as treatment for cerebral malformations or tuberous sclerosis, whereas ACTH proved more effective in perinatal hypoxic/ischemic injury. The efficacy of the two drugs was similar in cryptogenic cases. Disappearance of interictal EEG abnormalities occurred sooner in patients randomized to ACTH than in those who received VGB as initial therapy. During the second phase, the alternative drug was given to the resistant patients. Spasms ceased in 2 of 5 patients treated with VGB and in 11 of 12 patients treated with ACTH. After 3 months, relapses of spasms were observed in 6 patients treated with ACTH and in 1 treated with VGB. VGB produced a therapeutic response in nearly half the patients receiving this drug.CONCLUSIONS: Our data lend further support to the view that VGB may be considered a first-choice drug in the treatment of IS.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic patients under multiple injection insulin therapy (i.e., intensified insulin therapy, IIT) usually start this treatment during hospitalization. We report here on the logistics, efficacy, and safety of IIT, started in outpatients. Over 8 months, 52 type I and type II diabetics were followed up whose insulin regimens consecutively had been changed from conventional therapy to IIT. Two different IIT strategies were compared: free mixtures of regular and intermediate (12 hrs)-acting insulin versus the basal and prandial insulin treatment with preprandial injections of regular insulin, and ultralente (24 hrs-acting) or intermediate insulin for the basal demand. After 8 months HbA1 levels had decreased from 10.6% +/- 2.4% to 8.0% +/- 1.3% (mean +/- SD). There was no difference between the two regimens with respect to metabolic control; but type II patients maintained the lowered HbA1 levels better than type I patients. Only two patients were hospitalized during the follow-up time because of severe hypoglycemia. An increase of body weight due to the diet liberalization during IIT became a problem in one-third of the patients. Our results suggest that outpatient initiation of IIT is safe and efficacious with respect to near-normoglycemic control. Weight control may become a problem in IIT patients.",

    "abstract": "A 51 year old man took a mixed overdose including 1.8-3.6 g of diltiazem, paracetamol, aspirin, isosorbide nitrate, and alcohol. He initially presented to hospital after six hours with mild hypotension and was treated with activated charcoal and intravenous fluids. Eighteen hours after the overdose he had two generalised tonic-clonic seizures. The patient remained unresponsive with junctional bradycardia, unrecordable blood pressure, and then became asystolic. He was resuscitated with high dose (13.5 g) intravenous calcium and adrenaline (epinephrine). He required inotropic support and temporary pacing over the next 48 hours. This case suggests there is a role for aggressive high dose intravenous calcium therapy in severe diltiazem overdose, particularly with the onset of asystole. It should be considered early in cases of cardiac arrest after diltiazem overdose. The case also highlights the problems with delayed toxicity when whole bowel irrigation is not administered.",

Hypertensive patients (N = 507) with supinediastolic blood pressure (DBP) values between 100-115 mm Hg were included in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind study of 3x4 factorial design with a 2-4 week single-blind, placebo run-in and 6 week active treatment phase. The patients were randomized to 12 groups: placebo, ramipril (2.5, 5, 10 mg), felodipine ER (5, 10 mg), or ramipril-felodipine ER combinations (2.5/5 mg, 2.5/10 mg, 5/5 mg, 5/10 mg, 10/5 mg, 10/10 mg). Although the greatest reductions in blood pressure were observed with ramipril-felodipine ER (10/10 mg), consideration of the antihypertensive efficacy and safety factors suggest that the ramipril-felodipine ER (5/5 mg) combination has the best efficacy/tolerability ratio of the combinations tested. The incidence of adverse events with ramipril-felodipine ER combination therapy was similar to that with felodipine ER monotherapy, but peripheral edema, tachycardia and vasodilatation occurred less frequently with ramipril-felodipine ER (5/5 mg) combination than with felodipine ER monotherapy. The combination of ramipril-felodipine ER (5/5 mg) can be considered to be the most suitable option for hypertensive patients with an inadequate response to either of the monocomponents.",

N Engl J Med. 1998 Feb 26;338(9):619-20.BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Trials of antidepressant medications for smoking cessation have had mixed results. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a sustained-release form of bupropion for smoking cessation. We excluded smokers with current depression, but not those with a history of major depression. The 615 subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo or bupropion at a dose of 100, 150, or 300 mg per day for seven weeks. The target quitting date (or \"target quit date\") was one week after the beginning of treatment. Brief counseling was provided at base line, weekly during treatment, and at 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. Self-reported abstinence was confirmed by a carbon monoxide concentration in expired air of 10 ppm or less.RESULTS: At the end of seven weeks of treatment, the rates of smoking cessation as confirmed by carbon monoxide measurements were 19.0 percent in the placebo group, 28.8 percent in the 100-mg group, 38.6 percent in the 150-mg group, and 44.2 percent in the 300-mg group (P<0.001). At one year the respective rates were 12.4 percent, 19.6 percent, 22.9 percent, and 23.1 percent. The rates for the 150-mg group (P=0.02) and the 300-mg group (P=0.01) -- but not the 100-mg group (P=0.09) -- were significantly better than those for the placebo group. Among the subjects who were continuously abstinent through the end of treatment, the mean absolute weight gain was inversely associated with the dose (a gain of 2.9 kg in the placebo group, 2.3 kg in 100-mg and 150-mg groups, and 1.5 kg in the 300-mg group; P= 0.02). No effects of treatment were observed on depression scores as measured serially by the Beck Depression Inventory. Thirty-seven subjects stopped treatment prematurely because of adverse events; the frequency was similar among all groups.CONCLUSIONS: A sustained-release form of bupropion was effective for smoking cessation and was accompanied by reduced weight gain and minimal side effects. Many participants in all groups were smoking at one year.",

    "abstract": "Comment in    Gut. 1994 Jun;35(6):865. doi: 10.1136/gut.35.6.865-a.Lipiodol injected into the hepatic artery is selectively retained in hepatomas so has been used as a vehicle for cytotoxic drugs. This study compared treatment with 5-epidoxorubicin emulsified in lipiodol and infused into the hepatic artery with symptomatic treatment alone in a randomised trial. Of 136 patients with hepatoma 78 (57%) were not eligible, eight (6%) refused to take part, and 50 entered the trial (chemotherapy: n = 25, symptomatic treatment: n = 25). The two groups had similar prognostic indices. Seven of 25 patients allocated to chemotherapy were unable to receive it. The slight survival disadvantage associated with chemotherapy was not significant (median survival 48 days compared with 51 days, log rank chi 2 = 0.07, p > 0.05). Patients given chemotherapy spent significantly longer in hospital, however (median three days compared with one, p = 0.0008). Changes in symptoms and indices of tumour growth did not differ significantly between the two groups. It is concluded that infusion of 5-epidoxorubicin emulsified in lipiodol for hepatoma increased morbidity but did not affect survival. In addition, most patients were unsuitable for this treatment because of advanced disease. The patients in the trial had a short median survival time so the conclusions may not be valid for other patients with hepatoma.",

    "abstract": "We studied bone mineral density (BMD), bone metabolism, and body composition in 47 children with central precocious puberty (n = 36) or early puberty (n = 11) before, during, and after cessation of GnRH agonist. Bone density and body composition were measured with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and expressed as SD scores. Bone age and biochemical parameters of bone turnover were assessed. Measurements were performed at baseline, after 6 months, and on a yearly basis thereafter. Mean lumbar spine BMD SD scores for chronological age were significantly higher than zero at baseline and decreased during treatment. Lumbar spine bone mineral apparent density and total body BMD did not differ from normal at baseline and showed no significant changes during treatment. In contrast, BMD SD scores for bone age were significantly lower than zero at baseline and at cessation of therapy. Two years after therapy, bone mineral apparent density and BMD SD scores for bone age and chronological age did not differ from normal. Markers of bone turnover decreased during treatment, mainly in the first 6 months. Patients had increased percentage of fat and lean body mass at baseline. After an initial increase of percentage body fat during treatment, percentage body fat decreased and normalized within 1 yr after cessation of treatment. Our longitudinal analysis suggests that peak bone mass or body composition will not be impaired in patients with precocious or early puberty after GnRH agonist therapy.",

    "title": "Clinical pharmacokinetics of doxazosin in a controlled-release gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation.",
    "abstract": "AIMS: A controlled-release gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation of doxazosin mesylate, a long-acting selective alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist, was developed to enhance the pharmacokinetic profile and simplify the titration schedule by precisely controlling drug delivery rate, permitting an initial dose of 4 mg once daily, compared with standard doxazosin, which is initiated at 1 mg day-1 and titrated to a higher therapeutically effective dose. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of doxazosin GITS with respect to the effect of food, age and gender, and multiple dosing. In addition, in vitro performance was assessed in conditions simulating the gastrointestinal environment.METHODS: A three-way crossover study in 24 subjects assessed the comparative bioavailability of doxazosin GITS under fed and fasting conditions and doxazosin standard under fasting condition. A multiple-dose, two-way crossover study in 35 subjects assessed the comparative pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of doxazosin GITS and doxazosin standard 4 and 8 mg upon multiple dosing. A multiple-dose, four-parallel-group study was conducted to determine the steady-state pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of doxazosin GITS 4 mg in 41 young and elderly male and female subjects. The release-rate profiles of doxazosin GITS were determined in artificial gastric fluid (pH=1.2), intestinal fluid (pH=7.5), and water. The effect of agitation on the dissolution characteristics of doxazosin GITS in artificial gastric fluid was studied at stirring rates of 50, 75, and 100 rev min-1.RESULTS: In vitro studies demonstrated that release rates for the GITS tablet are independent of pH in the range of 1.2 (gastric) to 7. 5 (intestinal), and of stirring rates simulating gastrointestinal motility. Clinical pharmacology studies showed that doxazosin GITS had a lower maximum plasma concentration, prolonged time to reach maximum plasma concentration, and a higher minimum plasma concentration compared with doxazosin standard. Thus, the GITS formulation results in a more gradual absorption of doxazosin, and a reduced plasma doxazosin concentration peak-to-trough fluctuation ratio. The relative bioavailability of doxazosin GITS is approximately 60%. With a high-fat meal, the maximum plasma concentration and area under the concentration-time curve were 31% and 18% higher, respectively (P<0.05). Bioequivalence was established between the dose strengths of two 4 mg doxazosin GITS tablets and one 8 mg doxazosin GITS tablet. For both young adult and elderly subjects, and males and females, the pharmacokinetics of doxazosin GITS once daily for 7 days were comparable. Doxazosin GITS was well tolerated in the subjects studied, including young and elderly males and females.CONCLUSIONS: The GITS formulation of doxazosin enhances the pharmacokinetic profile compared with doxazosin standard, allowing more gradual absorption of doxazosin, and a reduced plasma doxazosin peak-to-trough concentration ratio. Thus, doxazosin GITS therapy can be initiated at a therapeutic dose of 4 mg with reduced haemodynamic side-effects.",

    "title": "Prognostic significance of transient ischemic episodes: response to treatment shows improved prognosis. Results of the Total Ischemic Burden Bisoprolol Study (TIBBs) follow-up.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The Total Ischemic Burden Bisoprolol Study (TIBBS) follow-up examined cardiac event rates in relation to transient ischemia and its treatment.BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether transient ischemia on the ambulatory electrocardiogram has prognostic implications in stable angina and whether medical treatment can improve the prognosis.METHODS: The TIBBS trial was an 8-week, randomized, controlled comparison of the effects of bisoprolol and nifedipine on transient ischemic episodes in patients with stable angina pectoris. Of the 545 patients screened, 520 (95.4%) could be followed up. Rates of cardiac and noncardiac death, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, hospital admission for unstable angina and need for coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were recorded.RESULTS: A total of 145 events occurred in 120 (23.1%) of 520 patients. Patients with more than six episodes had an event rate of 32.5% compared with 25.0% for patients with two to six episodes and 13.2% for patients with less than two episodes (p < 0.001). Hard events (death, acute myocardial infarction, hospital admission for unstable angina pectoris) were more frequent in patients with two or more ischemic episodes (12.2% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.0049). Patients with a 100% response rate of transient ischemic episodes during the TIBBS trial had a 17.5% event rate at 1 year compared with 32.3% for non-100% responders (p = 0.008). Patients receiving bisoprolol during the TIBBS tria had a lower event rate (22.1%) at 1 year than patients randomized to nifedipine (33.1%, p = 0.033).CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stable angina pectoris, frequent episodes of transient ischemia are a marker for an increased event rate. A 100% response to medical treatment reduces the event rate. The greater reduction of ischemia with bisoprolol than nifedipine during the TIBBS trial translated into an improved outcome at 1 year.",

    "title": "Treatment of silent ischemia in unstable angina: a randomized comparison of sustained-release verapamil versus metoprolol.",
    "abstract": "Silent ischemia is a frequent finding in patients with unstable angina and portends a poor prognosis. We compared the efficacy of sustained-release (SR) verapamil and metoprolol in reducing silent ischemia in patients with unstable angina and assessed whether detection of silent ischemia was related to unfavorable outcomes in the contemporary setting of concurrent therapy with heparin and aspirin. Holter monitoring (leads a VF, V2, V5) for the first 72 h was used to assess the frequency and duration of ST-shift episodes. There were 37 patients in the verapamil-SR group and 40 patients in the metoprolol group, with both groups having similar baseline characteristics. There were more episodes of angina in the verampamil-SR group (29 vs. 12, p = 0.05). There was no difference between the two groups in the frequency (51 vs. 49 episodes, p = 0.9) or duration (23 +/- 48 vs. 18 +/- 50 min, p = 0.6) of ST-shift episodes. There were 20 unfavorable in-hospital outcomes distributed equally between the two groups (p = 0.9). Patients with unfavorable outcomes had ST shift more often (50 vs. 28%, p = 0.07) and for a longer duration (40 +/- 69 vs. 13 +/- 38 min, p = 0.03). Patients with ST shift > or = 60 min had a 60% probability of unfavorable outcome compared with 33% for ST shift of 1-59 min duration and 20% for no ST shift (p = 0.04). We conclude that metoprolol appears to reduce symptoms better than verapamil-SR, but no difference in silent ischemia or unfavorable outcomes was seen. Silent ischemia remains a common occurrence in these patients despite heparin and aspirin therapy and its detection continues to have prognostic value.",

    "abstract": "A randomized controlled phase III clinical trial comparing TAP-144-SR (TAP) and diethylstilbestrol diphosphate was conducted for patients with prostatic cancer. Patients with Stage B, C, or D disease, who were previously untreated, were enrolled. TAP-144-SR 3.75 mg was administered subcutaneously at 4-week intervals for 12 weeks (a total of 3 injections) in the TAP-144-SR group, while 100 mg of diethylstilbestrol diphosphate was administered orally three times a day (before meals) for 12 weeks in the control group. A total of 141 patients were enrolled using a centralized telephone registration system. Four of these patients were ineligible, and there were 3 drop-outs who never received drugs because they withdrew their consents to participate in the trial. These 7 were excluded from the evaluation, and as a result, 134 patients (66 in the TAP group and 68 in the control group) were evaluable in safety and efficacy. Between the two groups, there were no significant differences in patient characteristics, except the age distribution. Clinical response rates (CR+PR) in evaluable patients according to the criteria of Japanese Prostatic Cancer Study Group were 54.5% in the TAP group and 47.1% in the control group. In addition, the rates according to the criteria for Evaluating the Direct Response to Chemotherapy in Solid Carcinomas and NPCP criteria were 7.6% in the TAP group and 8.8% in the control group and 18.2% in the TAP group and 20.6% in the control group, respectively. Using any of the three criteria, there were no significant differences in response rate between the two groups. The incidence of side effects was 64.1% in the TAP group and 95.4% in the control group; the incidence being significantly higher in the control group (p less than 0.001; chi 2-test). Therefore, the overall safety was significantly greater in the TAP group than in the control group (p less than 0.001; chi 2-test). On the basis of the efficacy and safety the clinical usefulness rate of TAP-144-SR was significantly higher than that of diethylstilbestrol diphosphate (p = 0.038; U-test). In conclusion, TAP-144-SR was confirmed to be more useful than diethylstilbestrol diphosphate as a standard drug for hormonal therapy of prostatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "Genetic instability within malignant cells gives rise to mutant proteins which can be recognized by the immune system. Recognition of tumor-associated antigens by T lymphocytes could thus contribute to the elimination of neoplastic cells. We have developed a molecular genetic intervention for the treatment of malignancies based upon the knowledge that foreign major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins expressed on the cell surface are efficient at stimulating an immune response. Expression of this foreign MHC gene within tumors induced a cytotoxic T cell response to the introduced gene. More importantly, the immune system recognized tumor-specific antigens on unmodified tumor cells as foreign. Growth of the tumors diminished, and in many cases, there was complete regression. This research provides evidence that direct gene transfer in vivo can induce cell-mediated immunity against specific gene products, and offers the potential for effective immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases in man. Our laboratory conducted a phase I clinical trial to determine the safety and efficacy of this treatment in humans. These studies suggest that direct gene transfer provides a safe and feasible approach for the treatment of human cancer. More recent developments using combination gene therapy and the initiation of a second human trial with improvements on this technology have been implemented. Finally, we have begun to define mechanisms of resistance to immune recognition by established malignancies.",

    "abstract": "Acyclovir cream has been available for the treatment of herpes labialis in numerous countries outside the United States for over a decade. Evidence for its efficacy comes from a few small clinical trials conducted in the 1980s. To examine more comprehensively the efficacy and safety of this formulation, we conducted two independent, identical, parallel, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, large-scale multicenter clinical trials. Healthy adults with a history of frequent herpes labialis were recruited from the general population, screened for eligibility, randomized equally to 5% acyclovir cream or vehicle control, given study medication, and told to self-initiate treatment five times daily for 4 days beginning within 1 h of the onset of a recurrent episode. The number of patients who treated a lesion was 686 in study 1 and 699 in study 2. In study 1, the mean duration of episodes was 4.3 days for patients treated with acyclovir cream and 4.8 days for those treated with the vehicle control (hazards ratio [HR] = 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06 to 1.44; P = 0.007). In study 2, the mean duration of episodes was 4.6 days for patients treated with acyclovir cream and 5.2 days for those treated with the vehicle control (HR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.44; P = 0.006). Efficacy was apparent whether therapy was initiated \"early\" (prodrome or erythema lesion stage) or \"late\" (papule or vesicle stage). There was a statistically significant reduction in the duration of lesion pain in both studies. Acyclovir cream did not prevent the development of classical lesions (progression to vesicles, ulcers, and/or crusts). Adverse events were mild and infrequent.",

    "title": "The clinical management of neuroendocrine tumors with long-acting repeatable (LAR) octreotide: comparison with standard subcutaneous octreotide therapy.",
    "abstract": "Neuroendocrine tumors are rare, occurring in less than 1% of the population. They are divided clinically into functionally active or non-active tumors. Functionally active tumors produce a variety of substances (mainly peptides or serotonin) that are responsible for symptoms and sometimes can lead to the death of the patient independently from tumor proliferation. The most important compounds that can control symptoms in these patients are somatostatin analogs. Native somatostatin is not suitable for long-term clinical application due to its short half-life. Therefore, synthetic drugs were developed with improved pharmacokinetic characteristics. The best-characterized analog, octreotide, has been successfully applied to patients with functioning tumors. Octreotide can ameliorate symptoms in 30%-70% of the patients, mainly through a direct inhibitory effect on hormone production from the tumors. There is little or no effect on tumor growth during octreotide therapy; clinical responses were recorded in only 10%-30% of the patients. Recently, significant improvement in the management of the disease has been demonstrated with long-acting repeatable (LAR) octreotide. This new formulation requires only one monthly intramuscolar injection, and shows better acceptability and patient compliance to therapy. Data available to date show superimposable results of both standard octreotide and LAR octreotide in controlling symptoms, lowering hormone and tumor marker levels, and in reducing tumor growth. The availability of long-acting molecules have permitted the exploration of high-dose therapy in increasing tumor shrinkage and prolonging survival. Although there is a clear dose-response trend, the published data are not conclusive and further investigations are needed. The possible lack of cross-resistance between LAR octreotide and a different analog, Lanreotide, is a very stimulating finding and this might lead to the development of new therapeutical strategies in the management of neuroendocrine tumors.",

    "title": "Orphan G-protein-coupled receptors: the next generation of drug targets?",
    "abstract": "The pharmaceutical industry has readily embraced genomics to provide it with new targets for drug discovery. Large scale DNA sequencing has allowed the identification of a plethora of DNA sequences distantly related to known G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), a superfamily of receptors that have a proven history of being excellent therapeutic targets. In most cases the extent of sequence homology is insufficient to assign these 'orphan' receptors to a particular receptor subfamily. Consequently, reverse molecular pharmacological and functional genomic strategies are being employed to identify the activating ligands of the cloned receptors. Briefly, the reverse molecular pharmacological methodology includes cloning and expression of orphan GPCRs in mammalian cells and screening these cells for a functional response to cognate or surrogate agonists present in biological extract preparations, peptide libraries, and complex compound collections. The functional genomics approach involves the use of 'humanized yeast cells, where the yeast GPCR transduction system is engineered to permit functional expression and coupling of human GPCRs to the endogenous signalling machinery. Both systems provide an excellent platform for identifying novel receptor ligands. Once activating ligands are identified they can be used as pharmacological tools to explore receptor function and relationship to disease.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: A new formulation, low dose microencapsulated aspirin, permits slow absorption of aspirin and presystemic acetylation of platelet cyclo-oxygenase within the portal circulation, potentially avoiding deleterious effects on gastric and systemic prostaglandin synthesis. The objective of this study was to determine whether the administration of microencapsulated aspirin was as effective as enteric coated (EC) aspirin as an inhibitor of platelet function in patients with atherosclerosis.METHODS: One hundred and four patients were enrolled and randomised after a run in period of at least 14 days on aspirin EC 75 mg (day 0), to receive either microencapsulated aspirin 162.5 mg (n=34), aspirin EC 150 mg (n=36) or continue on aspirin EC 75 mg (n=34) for 28 days. Serum thromboxane B2 and collagen-induced platelet aggregation and release of 5-hydroxytryptamine (EC50 values) were measured on days 0 and 28. Aggregation/release EC50s were then repeated in the presence of a large dose of aspirin added in vitro to determine the EC50 at the maximum level of platelet inhibition.RESULTS: Median thromboxane B2 levels were low after 14 days run-in therapy with aspirin EC 75 mg, but significant further reductions were seen on day 28 in patients randomised to microencapsulated aspirin 162.5 mg (P=0.0368) and aspirin EC 150 mg (P=0.0004) compared with those remaining on aspirin EC 75 mg. Median EC50 s on day 28 showed small but significant increases from baseline (day 0) in aggregation in patients randomised to microencapsulated aspirin 162.5 mg (0.62-0.85, P=0.0482) and in both aggregation and release in patients randomised to aspirin EC 150 mg (0.95-1.20, P=0.0002, 8.4-11.7, P<0. 0001, respectively) signifying enhanced antiplatelet activity. No changes were seen in patients continuing on aspirin EC 75 mg. Results following addition of high dose aspirin in vitro suggest that mechanisms other than thromboxane synthesis may be operative in the long term effects of microencapsulated aspirin 162.5 mg and aspirin EC 150 mg over aspirin EC 75 mg.CONCLUSIONS: The results show good inhibition of thromboxane B2 synthesis and subsequent platelet activity by all preparations of aspirin, although both microencapsulated aspirin 162.5 mg and aspirin EC 150 mg are slightly more effective than aspirin EC 75 mg. A randomised trial is now required to determine whether microencapsulated aspirin is associated with fewer gastric side-effects.",

N Engl J Med. 2005 Jan 27;352(4):410-4; author reply 410-4.BACKGROUND: In patients with persistent fever and neutropenia, amphotericin B is administered empirically for the early treatment and prevention of clinically occult invasive fungal infections. However, breakthrough fungal infections can develop despite treatment, and amphotericin B has substantial toxicity.METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial comparing liposomal amphotericin B with conventional amphotericin B as empirical antifungal therapy.RESULTS: The mean duration of therapy was 10.8 days for liposomal amphotericin B (343 patients) and 10.3 days for conventional amphotericin B (344 patients). The composite rates of successful treatment were similar (50 percent for liposomal amphotericin B and 49 percent for conventional amphotericin B) and were independent of the use of antifungal prophylaxis or colony-stimulating factors. The outcomes were similar with liposomal amphotericin B and conventional amphotericin B with respect to survival (93 percent and 90 percent, respectively), resolution of fever (58 percent and 58 percent), and discontinuation of the study drug because of toxic effects or lack of efficacy (14 percent and 19 percent). There were fewer proved breakthrough fungal infections among patients treated with liposomal amphotericin B (11 patients [3.2 percent]) than among those treated with conventional amphotericin B (27 patients [7.8 percent], P=0.009). With the liposomal preparation significantly fewer patients had infusion-related fever (17 percent vs. 44 percent), chills or rigors (18 percent vs. 54 percent), and other reactions, including hypotension, hypertension, and hypoxia. Nephrotoxic effects (defined by a serum creatinine level two times the upper limit of normal) were significantly less frequent among patients treated with liposomal amphotericin B (19 percent) than among those treated with conventional amphotericin B (34 percent, P<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Liposomal amphotericin B is as effective as conventional amphotericin B for empirical antifungal therapy in patients with fever and neutropenia, and it is associated with fewer breakthrough fungal infections, less infusion-related toxicity, and less nephrotoxicity.",

Controlled release absorption profiles in vivo were observed from the experimental microcapsules as revealed by the Wagner-Nelson method. The absorption lag time, absorption rate constant, and absorption half life were calculated by using the back projection method of residuals. A good correlation demonstrated between in vivo absorption and in vitro release data for both the products merits specific attention.

Fibroin tablets containing theophylline were easily prepared by a direct compression method without additives. Five types of fibroin tablets with the same surface area and different amounts of theophylline were prepared. In an in vitro drug study, the drug release from the tablets was not affected by the pH of the release medium. The greater the fibroin content in the tablets, the lower the percentage released at time t. The Higuchi plots of the release data showed a linear release profile, indicating that the drug release from the fibroin tablets was diffusion-controlled through the matrix. Theophylline powder or a TF-41 tablet (theophylline: fibroin=4 : 1), or a commercial tablet, Uniphyl (once-a-day type) was administered to 5 healthy volunteers. The areas under the saliva theophylline concentration-time curve (AUC) of Uniphyl and TF-41 to that of powder were 85% and 70%, respectively (fasted). Conversely, the mean residence time and mean absorption time of TF-41 were long compared to Uniphyl (fasted). Therefore, the reduction of bioavailability in TF-41 was due to the delayed release from the tablets in vivo. Taken after a meal, the AUCs of TF-41 and Uniphyl increased and the absorption was completed. This suggested that the drug release from TF-41 may increase due to the stimulation of food on TF-41 itself and due to movement of the gastro-intestinal tract. In conclusion, fibroin could be used as the matrix in controlled-release tablets.",

    "abstract": "The effects of monensin on the energy metabolism of dairy cows in early lactation were investigated in a large clinical trial that was randomized and double-blinded. A total of 1010 Holstein cows and first lactation heifers were allocated to receive a controlled-release capsule of monensin or a placebo at 3 wk prior to expected calving date. Treatments were randomized across 25 dairy farms located near Guelph, Ontario, Canada. Serum samples obtained at the time of treatment administration and at wk 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 postcalving were analyzed for beta-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, aspartate aminotransferase, urea, total protein, calcium, and phosphorus. Cows were also assigned a body condition score at the time each sample was obtained. Monensin treatment significantly reduced serum beta-hydroxy-butyrate concentrations at wk 1, 2, and 3 postpartum and significantly raised serum glucose concentrations during wk 1 and 2 of lactation. In addition, monensin treatment significantly reduced the loss of body condition score and decreased serum activity of aspartate aminotransferase during the postpartum period. Concentrations of serum urea were significantly higher during wk 2 and 3 postpartum for the cows that were treated with monensin. Monensin treatment had no effect on the concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, or total protein.",

One group of patients received controlled-release morphine every 12 h for 2 days before surgery, a second group received a single dose of controlled-release morphine 2 h before surgery and a third group received placebo. Patient-controlled analgesia system demands were compared for the first 38 h after surgery and 10-point pain scores and McGill pain questionnaires were compared for the first 6 postoperative days and at 6 weeks after surgery. During the first 2 days after surgery, patients reported high levels of pain which were similar in all groups. Pain scores on the third and fourth postoperative days were significantly lower in those who had a single pre-operative dose of controlled-release morphine compared with placebo and those who had been treated with-morphine every 12 h for 2 days (p = 0.043 and 0.024 for third and fourth day respectively). Patient-controlled analgesia demands were also fewer and less variable in those patients receiving the single dose of morphine 2 h before surgery. The study shows a beneficial analgesic effect of a single pre-operative dose of morphine, but shows no benefit for a more prolonged pre-operative dosing regimen.",

Mean Cmax, tmax, AUC (0,24h), AUC and tlag were significantly greater in fed compared with fasting subjects. Overall relative bioavailability of the two formulations (log AUC), was within the acceptable 80-125% limits for bioequivalence both fed and fasting. Mean fasting Cmax for OSR was greater than MST (P < 0.05) but there was no difference between formulations in mean fed Cmax. No statistically significant difference between OSR and MST was found for other parameters nor in the incidence of adverse events. These results suggest that OSR and MST are bioequivalent and that if patients were to transfer between formulations, dosage adjustment would be unnecessary, irrespective of their meal schedules or food intake.",

Pegylated (Stealth) liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (SL-DOX) has been demonstrated specifically to deliver high concentrations of doxorubicin to Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) lesions. This phase II study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SL-DOX in the treatment of moderate to severe AIDS-KS. Patients were treated biweekly with 10, 20, or 40 mg m-2 SL-DOX. Tumour response was assessed according to AIDS Clinical Trials Groups (ACTG) criteria before each cycle. Best response was determined for 238 patients and was achieved after a mean of 2.3 cycles (range 1-20). Fifteen patients (6.3%) had a complete response to SL-DOX, 177 (74.4%) had a partial response, 44 (18.5%) had stable disease and two (0.8%) had disease progression. SL-DOX was well tolerated: ten patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events, in four cases because of neutropenia. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred after 281 of 2023 cycles (13.9%) but involved 137 of 240 patients (57.1%) for whom data were available. SL-DOX has substantial activity in AIDS-KS. Best response is typically seen after fewer than three cycles of chemotherapy and in some cases may be prolonged. The most important adverse event is neutropenia, which occurs after a minority of cycles but which may occur in over half of all patients.",

    "title": "Selection of medical treatment in stable angina pectoris: results of the International Multicenter Angina Exercise (IMAGE) Study.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to investigate which characteristics of anginal symptoms or exercise test results could predict the favorable anti-ischemic effect of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent metoprolol and the calcium antagonist nifedipine in patients with stable angina pectoris.BACKGROUND: The characteristics of anginal symptoms and the results of exercise testing are considered of great importance for selecting medical treatment in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. However, little information is available on how this first evaluation may be used to select the best pharmacologic approach in individual patients.METHODS: In this prospective multicenter study, 280 patients with stable angina pectoris were enrolled in 25 European centers. After baseline evaluation, consisting of an exercise test and a questionnaire investigating patients' anginal symptoms, the patients were randomly allocated to double-blind treatment for 6 weeks with either metoprolol (Controlled Release, 200 mg once daily) or nifedipine (Retard, 20 mg twice daily) according to a parallel group design. At the end of this period, exercise tests were repeated 1 to 4 h after drug intake.RESULTS: Both metoprolol and nifedipine prolonged exercise tolerance over baseline levels; the improvement was greater in the patients receiving metoprolol (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that low exercise tolerance was the only variable associated with a more favorable effect within each treatment group. Metoprolol was more effective than nifedipine in patients with a lower exercise tolerance or with a higher rate-pressure product at rest and at ischemic threshold. None of the characteristics of anginal symptoms or exercise test results predicted a greater efficacy of nifedipine over metoprolol.CONCLUSIONS: The results of a baseline exercise test, but not the characteristics of anginal symptoms, may offer useful information for selecting medical treatment in stable angina pectoris.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Escherichia coli heat labile enterotoxin (LT) at doses of 5 micro g or 10 micro g has adjuvant activity for oral immunisation in humans infected with Helicobacter pylori, but causes severe diarrhoea. This study was undertaken to establish a safe and effective dose of LT, to confirm the safety of recombinant urease, and to compare the immunogenicity of orally compared with enterically delivered urease.METHODS: 42 healthy adults without present or past H pylori infection were randomised to receive 60 mg recombinant H pylori urease in soluble or in encapsulated form, given with doses of LT ranging from 0 micro g to 2.5 micro g. Four oral doses were administered at day 1, 8, 29, and 57. Specific IgG, IgA, and antibody secreting cells were measured as well as total alpha4beta7 integrin positive lymphocyte responses.RESULTS: Enterically delivered urease was well tolerated and no serious adverse events occurred. Mild diarrhoea (one to four loose stools) occurred after the first immunisation in 50% (6 of 12) of the volunteers exposed to 2.5 micro g LT (p=0.06; paired t test, compared with baseline) but not in volunteers exposed to lower LT doses. Immune responses occurred in five (p=0.048; Fisher's exact test), one, two, and one of six subjects exposed to 2.5 micro g, 0.5 micro g, 0.1 micro g, and no LT, respectively. Significant CD4(+), CD69(+), and CD45RO(hi) responses occurred over time among alpha4beta7(hi) lymphocytes in volunteers receiving 2.5 micro g LT. Enterically delivered urease induced higher lymphocyte responses than soluble urease.CONCLUSIONS: The safety of H pylori urease is confirmed. Oral LT may conserve its adjuvant activity at low doses with minimal side effects.",

One site served as an untreated control. The remaining three sites received treatment with a SPF 15 sunscreen containing 0.25% AGR (Eucerin Gel Cream Phase 2) 30 minutes before irradiation. Two of these sites were additionally pretreated with the corresponding AGR-containing vehicle (Eucerin Gel Cream Phase 1) twice daily for 3 and 7 days, respectively. The second study was conducted as a controlled in-use-test in patients with PLE (n = 27) or acne aestivalis (n = 3), who had suffered from the disease during their last year's vacation. They were educated to apply the pre-sun preparation to the formerly affected skin areas twice daily for 1 week before their planned vacation and to use the SPF 15 sunscreen 30 minutes before each vacation sun exposure. Symptoms were recorded in patients' diaries throughout the vacation and documented by a physician after their return.RESULTS: In the first study, protection of skin with the SPF 15 sunscreen alone led to a significant prevention of PLE symptoms, especially itch, compared with the control area. Pretreatment further reduced the severity of PLE significantly and led to total prevention in 19 patients. In the second study, whereas 92.6% had reported severe and 7.4% mild PLE in the last year, there were currently only 7.4% severe cases, with 25.9% mild and 29.6% questionable cases; 37% had no symptoms at all. Also, two out of three acne aestivalis patients had diminished symptoms after treatment.CONCLUSION: The results confirm the prophylactic efficacy of the antioxidant AGR in PLE, applied as SPF 15 sunscreen alone or additionally to pretreatment with a corresponding pre-sun preparation, and also show an effect in acne aestivalis patients.",

Patients were investigated after 2, 4, 6, and 24 weeks of treatment.RESULTS: A reduction of heart rate was observed on the first dose (12.5 mg once daily), from a mean (SD) of 74 (11) to 67 (11) beats/min, p < 0.05. This was accompanied by prominent effects on AV plane filling parameters, including an increase in early diastolic filling period from 87 (28) to 105 (33) ms (p < 0.05), and in the lateral AV plane fractional shortening from 8.7 (2.7)% to 10.2 (2.8)% (p < 0.05). An early trend towards improvement in global systolic left ventricular function was also seen, although this was not significant until six weeks. Ejection fraction increased from 33 (7.5)% to 38 (11)% (p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: First effects of left ventricular recovery during beta blocker treatment were seen in recordings of longitudinal performance, as expressed by AV plane displacement. Doppler flow dynamics as well as global systolic recovery appeared several weeks later, emphasising the importance of longitudinal performance in evaluating left ventricular function.",

Better pain relief was the main reason for preference for fentanyl given by 35% of patients. More patients considered pain control as being \"good\" or \"very good\" with fentanyl than with morphine (35% v 23%, P=0.002). These results were reflected in both patients' and investigators' opinions on the global efficacy of transdermal fentanyl. Patients receiving fentanyl had on average higher quality of life scores than those receiving morphine. The incidence of adverse events was similar in both treatment groups; however, more patients experienced constipation with morphine than with fentanyl (48% v 29%, P<0.001). Overall, 41% of patients experienced mild or moderate cutaneous problems associated with wearing the transdermal fentanyl patch, and more patients withdrew because of adverse events during treatment with fentanyl than with morphine (10% v 5%). However, within the subgroup of patients naive to both fentanyl and morphine, similar numbers of patients withdrew owing to adverse effects (11% v 10%, respectively).CONCLUSION: Transdermal fentanyl was preferred to sustained release oral morphine by patients with chronic non-cancer pain previously treated with opioids. The main reason for preference was better pain relief, achieved with less constipation and an enhanced quality of life.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Steroid dependent patients with Crohn's disease are at high risk of developing glucocorticosteroid induced side effects.AIMS: We evaluated the possibility of switching from systemic steroids to budesonide (Entocort) in prednisolone/prednisone dependent patients with inactive Crohn's disease affecting the ileum and/or ascending colon.PATIENTS: Steroid dependent patients with a Crohn's disease activity index </=200 were included.METHODS: In a double blind multicentre trial, 120 patients were randomly assigned to receive budesonide 6 mg once daily or placebo. Prednisolone was tapered to zero during the first 4-10 weeks and budesonide or placebo was given concomitantly and for a further 12 weeks. Relapse was defined as an index >200 and an increase of 60 points from baseline or withdrawal due to disease deterioration.RESULTS: After one and 13 weeks without prednisolone, relapse rates were 17% and 32%, respectively, in the budesonide group, and 41% and 65% in the placebo group (95% confidence intervals for the difference in percentages -41%, -8% and -51%, -16%; p=0.004 and p<0.001, respectively). The number of glucocorticosteroid side effects was reduced by 50% by switching from prednisolone and was similar in the budesonide and placebo groups. Basal plasma cortisol increased in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with steroid dependent ileocaecal Crohn's disease may be switched to budesonide controlled ileal release capsules 6 mg without relapse, resulting in a sharp decrease in glucocorticosteroid side effects similar to placebo, and with an increase in plasma cortisol levels.",

    "title": "Liposome-mediated delivery of antiviral agents to human immunodeficiency virus-infected cells.",
    "abstract": "Intracellular delivery of novel macromolecular drugs against human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), including antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, ribozymes and therapeutic genes, may be achieved by encapsulation in or association with certain types of liposomes. Liposomes may also protect these drugs against nucleases. Low-molecular-weight, charged antiviral drugs may also be delivered more efficiently via liposomes. Liposomes were targeted to HIV-1-infected cells via covalently coupled soluble CD4. An HIV-1 protease inhibitor encapsulated in conventional negatively charged multilamellar liposomes was about 10-fold more effective and had a lower EC90 than the free drug in inhibiting HIV-1 production in human monocyte-derived macrophages. The drug encapsulated in sterically stabilized liposomes was as effective as the free drug. The EC50 of the reverse transcriptase inhibitor 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) was reduced by an order of magnitude when delivered to HIV-1-infected macrophages in pH-sensitive liposomes. A 15-mer antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against the Rev response element was ineffective in free form against HIV-1 replication in macrophages, while delivery of the oligonucleotide in pH-sensitive liposomes inhibited virus replication. The oligodeoxynucleotide encapsulated in sterically stabilized pH-sensitive liposomes with prolonged circulation in vivo, which were recently developed in the laboratories of the authors, was also highly effective. A ribozyme complementary to HIV-1 5'-LTR delivered in pH-sensitive liposomes inhibited virus production by 90%, while the free ribozyme caused only a slight inhibition. Cationic liposome-mediated co-transfection of the HIV-regulated diphtheria toxin A fragment gene and a proviral HIV clone into HeLa cells completely inhibited virus production, while the frame-shifted mutant gene was ineffective. Co-transfection of the proviral genome and a gene encoding a Rev-binding aptamer into HeLa cells via transferrin-associated cationic liposomes inhibited virus production. These studies indicate that liposomes can be used to facilitate the intracellular delivery of certain anti-HIV agents and to enhance their therapeutic effects. These properties may be particularly advantageous in the development of novel macromolecular drugs, which may be necessary because of the emergence of virus strains resistant to the currently available drugs.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the pharmacodynamic equivalence of the new 10.8 mg. goserelin depot with the current 3.6 mg. depot 3 studies were performed in patients with advanced prostate cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2 comparative studies 160 patients were randomized for dosing every 12 weeks using the 10.8 mg. depot or every 4 weeks using the 3.6 mg. depot. In the noncomparative study 35 patients received the 10.8 mg. depot. Blood sampling for serum testosterone and evaluation of toxicity was done during the 48-week study period.RESULTS: Serum testosterone profiles of the 10.8 and 3.6 mg. goserlin depots were similar with testosterone levels decreasing into the castrate range by day 21 after depot administration. The safety profile of 10.8 mg. goserelin is comparable to that of the current monthly depot with the main side effects related to androgen deprivation.CONCLUSIONS: The new long acting depot was pharmacologically equivalent, and well tolerated locally and systemically, and will offer added convenience to patients and health care personnel.",

    "abstract": "Two series of matrix tablets for the newly developed anti-histaminergic drug, TA-5707F, were prepared: one series with an entero-soluble polymer, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetyl succinate (HPMC-AS), and one series with a hydrophilic gel-forming polymer, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC). In the JP dissolution test of HPMC-AS tablets, as the soluble-pH of HPMC-AS was increased, the dissolution of the drug in the JP XII second fluid (pH 6.8) was increasingly delayed, and the duration time of the constant plasma level in fasted dogs was increased. However, the absorption of TA-5707F in fed dogs was markedly diminished. In the JP dissolution test, the HPMC tablets showed a zero order dissolution profile, being the same in both the JP first (pH 1.2) and the JP second fluids. The H-2 tablet, containing HPMC 60SH-4000 and lactose, showed a constant plasma level in fasted dogs. However, this tablet was disintegrated by the ingestion of food. The H-3 tablet containing a lot of HPMC 60SH-4000, but not lactose, showed insufficient duration in fasted dogs, but its plasma profile was less affected by food, and the propantheline bromide pretreatment extended the constant plasma level in dogs. Thus, the H-3 tablets were considered promising for human use. Then, H-2 and H-3 tablets were administered to humans; however, the plasma concentration profiles did not show sufficient duration time for either tablet. TA-5707F was considered to have been released slowly in human gastro-intestinal (GI) tract due to more moderate GI mobility.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of goserelin depot and danazol for endometriosis.DESIGN: Open, randomized comparative trial.SETTING: Multicenter European academic clinical institutions.PATIENTS: A total of 307 patients with laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis were randomized to goserelin (n = 204) or danazol (n = 103); 249 patients underwent second look laparoscopy (175 received goserelin and 74 danazol) and were analyzed for efficacy.INTERVENTIONS: A 3.6-mg depot of goserelin monthly subcutaneously or oral danazol 200 mg three times a day administered for 24 weeks.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Efficacy assessments were based on changes in visible deposits at laparoscopy before and after treatment and subjective symptom scores at 4-week intervals during treatment and 8-week intervals after treatment for up to 24 weeks. Safety was assessed by adverse event reporting and clinical laboratory measures.RESULTS: There were similar proportions of symptomatic (73%) and asymptomatic (but infertile) (27%) and comparable distribution of different severity of endometriosis randomized to each treatment. Significantly fewer patients randomized to goserelin (6.4%) withdrew during treatment compared with 20.4% randomized to danazol (P less than 0.05). There were significantly reduced visible deposits of endometriosis found post-treatment (P less than 0.0001) within each group but no differences between the treatments. The mean total subjective symptoms scores remained significantly less than entry at 24 weeks post-treatment (P less than 0.05). Hypoestrogenic side effects were more common in those receiving goserelin, particularly hot flushes, but anabolic/androgenic side effects of weight gain and muscle cramps were more common in those receiving danazol.CONCLUSIONS: The monthly administered 3.6-mg depot preparation of goserelin was highly effective at inducing resolution of endometriotic implants and relieving the symptoms of endometriosis with prevention of their return during 24 weeks follow-up in the majority of patients. However, results were not significantly different from those achieved with danazol 600 mg/d.",

Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and beta2-agonist consumption were recorded during three menstrual cycles in 67 females with mild-severe asthma. All were treated with inhaled glucocorticosteroids (IGC) and beta2-agonists, as required. Following, the patients with a premenstrual reduction in PEFR > 20%, received either salmeterol, 50 microg x 2 day(-1) or placebo, in the 10 days leading up to the menses, in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design. Thirteen patients (19.4%) showed PME (mean +/- SEM decrease in PEFR 27 +/- 2.2%) in association with a significant increase in the mean daily beta2-agonist consumption. Following administration of salmeterol, there was a complete ablation of the PME in seven patients, a partial ablation in two patients and no effect in the remaining four patients. Only one patient showed a partial ablation of the PME following placebo. There was also a significant decrease in the beta2-agonists consumption in the responders. About 20% of the women with asthma, under chronic IGC treatment, had PME of asthma. In 54% of them, it could be prevented by the use of long-acting bronchodilators (LABD) during the 10 days leading up to the menses, and partially prevented in another 15%.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of valvular regurgitation and abnormal valve morphology in patients three to five months after discontinuation of dexfenfluramine (Dexfen) therapy.BACKGROUND: We previously reported the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of valvular structure and function in 1,073 patients treated either with Dexfen, with an investigational sustained-release dexfenfluramine (Dexfen SR), or with a placebo, with echocardiograms performed approximately one month from the last dose. Using FDA criteria (aortic regurgitation [AR] > or =mild and/or mitral regurgitation [MR] > or =moderate) we found no statistical difference among the groups, but when all degrees of valvular regurgitation were considered and when the two Dexfen groups were combined, there was a higher prevalence of any degree of AR, any degree of MR, and restricted posterior mitral leaflet mobility. However, it was unknown whether these differences in prevalence persisted.METHODS: The double blind was maintained, and all patients were invited to return for a follow-up echocardiogram. Echocardiograms were acquired using a standardized protocol and assessed blindly to determine the degree of valvular regurgitation and valve leaflet thickness and mobility. We had an 80% power to detect a statistically significant change in paired proportions using the McNemar test (alpha = 0.05).RESULTS: Echocardiograms were obtained on 941 patients with a median of 137 days after drug discontinuation. Aortic regurgitation (of any degree) was present in 13.8% of Dexfen (p = 0.41 compared to placebo), 10.7% of Dexfen SR (p = 0.64 compared to placebo), and 11.9% of placebo patients. The minor differences between patients treated with active drug versus placebo, which were found in the previous study, were no longer significant even when the groups were combined (p = 0.83 compared to placebo). Mitral regurgitation (of any degree) was present in 71.5% (p = 0.15 compared to placebo), 69.8% (p = 0.30 compared to placebo), and 70.5%, respectively. This was also not significantly different from placebo when both Dexfen groups were combined (p = 0.16). There was no difference in the prevalence of restricted posterior mitral leaflet mobility among the three groups (p = 0.19).CONCLUSIONS: The small increase in prevalence of minor degrees of AR and MR in patients treated with two to three months of Dexfen previously reported is no longer present three to five months after discontinuation of medication. These data suggest that the degree of regurgitation observed in patients who used Dexfen for a relatively short duration does not progress over time.",

    "title": "Bupropion slow-release response in depression: diagnosis and biochemistry.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bupropion has been previously shown to be particularly beneficial in bipolar and atypical depression. Previous research has supported a possible association of response to plasma levels and to changes in plasma homovanillic acid (HVA). These findings were here extended to bupropion slow-release (SR), a formulation with slower release kinetics.METHODS: Forty-one patients with major depressive disorder (DSM-III-R) completed 8 weeks of a fixed dose of 300 mg/day in two doses/day. Clinical outcome measures were the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Biological parameters included plasma HVA and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl-glycol (MHPG), as well as a final measurement of plasma bupropion and its metabolites.RESULTS: Response to bupropion SR differed among the three groups: results for change in HDRS and in BDI were greater in the bipolar and atypical than in the \"typical\" depressed patients. Mean change in HDRS was, respectively, of 15.6, 17.1, and 7.6 (F = 5.57, p < .01); mean change in the BDI, 21.1, 16.9, and 7.3 (F = 3.32, p < .05). Threobupropion levels correlated with HDRS scores (r = .47, p = .02, n = 23); plasma HVA and MHPG increased significantly (t = 2.31, p = .03; t = 2.15, p = .04, n = 17). Bipolar depressed patients' improvement in HDRS was related to increases in MHPG (r = .87, p = .01) and in HVA (r = .70, p = .08).CONCLUSIONS: This fixed-dose study indicates that there may be specific benefits for bupropion SR in atypical and bipolar depression, and that these benefits may be related also to plasma levels and biochemical changes in catecholamines. Due to the small sample size, replication is of key importance.",

A total of 205 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension were randomized to receive either the sustained-release (SRO) formulation of isradipine (n = 103) or amlodipine (n = 102), both at dosages of 5 mg once daily. Blood pressure measurements were taken at the end of the dosing interval to assess the antihypertensive efficacy of the two drugs. 3. Adverse reactions were assessed in two ways: a) spontaneously reported adverse events were recorded and investigated in depth for severity, duration, relation to the study drug, and outcome; b) a questionnaire was used to elicit specific adverse reactions known to be related to the use of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists which were evaluated for severity, duration, relation to the study drug, and outcome. 4. After 6 weeks of active treatment, both isradipine and amlodipine reduced mean sitting systolic/diastolic blood pressure: from 165.1/100.1 to 145.2/89.7 mm Hg with isradipine; and from 164.1/100.6 to 145.7/90.5 mm Hg with amlodipine. There was no difference in antihypertensive effect between isradipine and amlodipine (95% CI: -3.73 to 4.73 and -1.89 to 3.49 for differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively). 5. The number of patients spontaneously reporting adverse events was significantly higher (P = 0.02; 95% CI: 3.1 to 26.7%) with amlodipine (33.3%) than with isradipine (18.4%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Surg Neurol. 2003 Mar;59(3):146-7.BACKGROUND: The need for repeated treatment of restenosis of a treated vessel remains the main limitation of percutaneous coronary revascularization. Because sirolimus (rapamycin) inhibits the proliferation of lymphocytes and smooth-muscle cells, we compared a sirolimus-eluting stent with a standard uncoated stent in patients with angina pectoris.METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind trial to compare the two types of stents for revascularization of single, primary lesions in native coronary arteries. The trial included 238 patients at 19 medical centers. The primary end point was in-stent late luminal loss (the difference between the minimal luminal diameter immediately after the procedure and the diameter at six months). Secondary end points included the percentage of in-stent stenosis of the luminal diameter and the rate of restenosis (luminal narrowing of 50 percent or more). We also analyzed a composite clinical end point consisting of death, myocardial infarction, and percutaneous or surgical revascularization at 1, 6, and 12 months.RESULTS: At six months, the degree of neointimal proliferation, manifested as the mean (+/-SD) late luminal loss, was significantly lower in the sirolimus-stent group (-0.01+/-0.33 mm) than in the standard-stent group (0.80+/-0.53 mm, P<0.001). None of the patients in the sirolimus-stent group, as compared with 26.6 percent of those in the standard-stent group, had restenosis of 50 percent or more of the luminal diameter (P<0.001). There were no episodes of stent thrombosis. During a follow-up period of up to one year, the overall rate of major cardiac events was 5.8 percent in the sirolimus-stent group and 28.8 percent in the standard-stent group (P<0.001). The difference was due entirely to a higher rate of revascularization of the target vessel in the standard-stent group.CONCLUSIONS: As compared with a standard coronary stent, a sirolimus-eluting stent shows considerable promise for the prevention of neointimal proliferation, restenosis, and associated clinical events.",

Baseline mean probing depth recordings were similar between the two groups (DH = 5.9 mm; SRP = 5.9 mm). Mean month 9 results showed similar clinical results for attachment level gain (DH 0.7 mm; SRP 0.8 mm) and probing depth reduction (DH 1.3 mm; SRP 1.1 mm). Percentage of sites showing > or =2 mm attachment level gain at month 9 was 24.7% in the DH group and 21.2% in the SRP group. Thirty-nine percent (39%) of DH sites and 38% of SRP sites showed > or =2 mm probing depth reduction. When treated sides of the dentition were compared to untreated sides, DH showed a difference in disease activity (> or =2 mm attachment loss) from 19.3% (untreated) to 7.2% (treated); and SRP from 14.3% (untreated) to 8.1% (treated).CONCLUSIONS: Results show that both DH without concomitant mechanical instrumentation and SRP were equally effective as SPT in this patient group over the 9-month study period.",

After the treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) over 2 years, he was diagnosed as carcinoid syndrome on the appearance of facial flushing, face edema and watery diarrhea accompanied by high levels of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) in blood and urine. Prednisolone, which was initially effective, was replaced by SMS201-995 due to the considerable dose increase of the former because its effect became insufficient during the course of the treatment. Clinical symptoms were improved by SMS201-995 and blood 5-HIAA level decreased gradually but markedly. Thus better results were obtained by SMS201-995 compared with prednisolone. These results imply that SMS201-995 is appreciated as an effective drug for treatment of carcinoid syndrome.",

As percutaneous coronary intervention increasingly involves the use of stents, ISR is also becoming correspondingly more frequent. In this review, we examine the available studies of the histology and pathogenesis of ISR, with particular reference to porcine and other animal models. An overview of mechanical treatments is then provided, which includes PTCA, directional coronary atherectomy and high speed rotational atherectomy. Radiation-based therapies are discussed, including a summary of current problems associated with this modality of treatment. Finally, novel strategies for the prevention of ISR are addressed, including novel developments in stents and stent coatings, conventional drugs, nucleic acid-based drugs and gene transfer. Until recently, limited pharmacologic and mechanical treatment options have been available for both treatment and prevention of ISR. However, recent advances in gene modification and gene transfer therapies and, more particularly, in local stent-based drug delivery systems make it conceivable that the incidence of ISR will now be seriously challenged.",

A Genome Ontology annotation of 30585 sequences in the provisional human proteome set recognises 498 proteases, i.e. 1.6%. Homology searches against finished sequence and comparisons between mouse and zebrafish are likely to increase this total. However, the data already indicate that the mechanistic class, sequence family and domain distribution of the genomic complement of proteases is unlikely to shift significantly from that already observed in the transcript data. Genomically derived novel sequences will require bioinformatic analysis and biochemical verification. The increasing availability of annotated genomic data will enable studies of splice variants, transcriptional control, polymorphisms, pseudogenes, inactive homologues and evolution. Comparative work on complete human protease families should produce a more integrated picture of their biochemistry and physiology. Genomic data will also lead to the identification of new protease involvement in disease processes and their evaluation as drug targets.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacogenetics refers to the genetic factors that influence the response to a drug, often involving genetic variations in drug metabolizing enzymes. The pharmacogenetics of antiplatelet agents is in its infancy and largely reflects variations in drug targets or related genes. One particular gene variant, the PlA2 polymorphism of the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor, is now emerging as a probable determinant of the response to antiplatelet agents including GPIIb/IIIa antagonists. This variant may in part explain the heterogeneity in the response to GPIIb/IIIa antagonists. The PlA2 genotype appears to be associated with an adverse outcome in patients treated with an oral GPIIb/IIIa antagonist and may be a factor in the observed failure of these agents in unselected populations. However, there are preliminary indications that other antiplatelet agents may have an enhanced effect in PlA2 subjects. Further clinical trials in particular are required to definitively characterize the pharmacogenetic effect of PlA2. Other polymorphisms are also likely to contribute to the pharmacogenetics of antiplatelet agents, but these await investigation.",

    "title": "Antisense inhibition of virus infections.",
    "abstract": "This chapter summarizes the new approaches to identify novel antiviral drug targets and to develop novel antiviral strategies. The chapter also reviews genetic pharmacology as it relates to antiviral antisense research and drug development. Antisense oligonucleotides are selective compounds by virtue of their interaction with specific segments of RNA. For potential antivirals, identification of appropriate target RNA sequences for antisense oligonucleotides is performed at two levels: the optimal gene within the virus, and the optimal sequence within the RNA. The importance of these oligonucleotide modifications in designing effective drugs is just now being evaluated, both in animal model systems and in the clinic. The first generation of widely used antisense oligonucleotides has been the phosphorothioate (PS) compounds and a body of data on biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism in animals and in humans is now available. Since the identification and sequencing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there has been a strong interest in identifying a potent oligonucleotide inhibitor that would have the potential for development as a therapy for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Numerous phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, with no apparent antisense sequence specificity, can have an anti-herpes simplex virus (HSV) effect. Oligonucleotides can be effective anti-influenza agents in cell culture assays. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein that is a transactivator has been also reported to be targeted successfully by antisense oligonucleotides in vivo. Several of picornaviruses have been targets for antisense oligonucleotide inhibition, and the studies demonstrate the versatility of the antisense approach. However, the fact that oligonucleotides may contribute numerous mechanisms toward the antiviral activity, in addition to the antisense mechanism, may in some cases be an asset in the pursuit of clinically useful antiviral drugs.",

We have compared lung and total systemic delivery of salbutamol from a nebuliser with that from a metered dose inhaler by measuring urinary recovery of drug and its sulphate metabolite.METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers provided urine samples at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h after the start of dosing. Formulations and doses were 5 x 100 microg oral solution (ORAL), 5 x 100 microg from a metered dose inhaler (MDI), 2.5 mg using a nebuliser (NEB) and NEB with 25 g oral charcoal (NEBC). Each study phase was separated by 7 days and the order of dosing was randomized.RESULTS: Mean (s.d.) 30 min urinary salbutamol excretion after ORAL, MDI, NEB and NEBC was 0.4 (0.7), 12.1 (3.7), 15.0 (3.9) and 18.2 (5.7) microg, respectively (all P<0.001 compared with ORAL). When normalized for the dose available for inhalation from MDI, NEB and NEBC, the mean (s.d.) 30 min urinary excretion of salbutamol was 2.4 (0.7), 2.9 (0.6) and 2.7 (0.6)%, respectively, with a mean ratio (90% confidence interval) between NEB and NEBC, of 95.3 (91.1, 99.5)%. The mean (s.d.) excretion of salbutamol plus its metabolite over 24 h post ORAL, MDI, NEB and NEBC dosing was 297.9 (38.3), 290.3 (41.4), 266.5 (44.6) and 151.7 (40.9) microg, respectively. The mean ratio (90% confidence interval) between MDI and ORAL, and NEB and ORAL were 97.5 (94.1, 101.0) and 90.7 (81.2, 100.2)%, respectively. The NEBC data indicate that 6.07 (1.04)% of the nominal nebulized dose was delivered to the lungs.CONCLUSIONS: The 30 min urinary recovery of salbutamol, an index of the relative systemic bioavailability of salbutamol following inhalation, can be used to compare the lung deposition of nebulized systems. Similarly, the urinary 24 h recovery of salbutamol plus its metabolite, an index of the relative systemic bioavailability of salbutamol following inhalation, can be used to compare the delivery of nebulized drug to the systemic circulation.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosomatids produce significant amounts of four major low molecular mass thiols, trypanothione, glutathionylspermidine, glutathione, and ovothiol A. Of these, only glutathione is present in cells of the host. All four low molecular mass thiols are directly or indirectly maintained in a reduced state by trypanothione reductase. Available evidence, from gene disruption studies, indicate that this is an essential enzyme. Attempts to exploit trypanothione reductase as a chemotherapeutic target lead to the design of competitive and irreversible inhibitors of the enzyme. A promising route involves the design of redox cyclers interacting specifically with trypanothione reductase as subversive substrates. Progress in studies on the biosynthesis of ovothiol A is summarized.",

    "title": "Colchicine and antineoplastic therapy for the prevention of restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions.",
    "abstract": "The complexity of the events that culminate in intimal proliferation after arterial injury and similarities between this response and benign neoplasia suggest that conventional medical therapies will continue to be unsuccessful in preventing recurrent stenosis after percutaneous coronary revascularization. By preventing cell division after smooth muscle cell activation, antimitogenic therapy may inhibit the final common pathway in this complex chain of events and offset the apparent loss of local growth control. Colchicine, which causes metaphase arrest of cell division, has been shown in experimental studies to decrease the extent of atheromatous plaque formation and reduce the severity of arterial restenosis after balloon angioplasty. However, preliminary results from a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial suggest that low dose colchicine (0.6 mg twice a day orally) does not prevent restenosis. The use of more potent antineoplastic agents is limited by the potential for life-threatening side effects. It is possible that these adverse effects can be averted by using novel drug delivery systems to administer antimitogenic therapy locally at the site of arterial injury or by using low dose synergistic combinations of antiproliferative agents. This review examines the potential role of antimitogenic therapy in the prevention of restenosis after coronary interventions and considers the possibility of an overlap of the therapeutic realms of interventional cardiology and medical oncology.",

Acad Emerg Med. 2002 Sep;9(9):960. doi: 10.1111/j.1553-2712.2002.tb02199.x.Rapid and ultrarapid opioid detoxification (ROD and UROD) centers promise quick, painless, same-day detoxification treatment for patients with opioid addiction. The goal of ROD and UROD is to provide a rapid transition from opioid dependency to oral naltrexone therapy. The patient is given general anesthesia and high-dose opioid antagonists. This induces a severe withdrawal but spares the patient the experience. In theory, the process is complete within four to five hours. The patient awakens without opioid dependency and is started on oral naltrexone. Any subsequent, persistent withdrawal symptoms are treated symptomatically. A novel, unapproved approach is to compound a pellet of naltrexone and implant it in the subcutaneous tissue. In theory, this should result in continuous therapeutic levels for this drug, and avoid issues with noncompliance.CASE SERIES: This article reports six cases of complications from the same detoxification center that performed UROD with naltrexone pellet implantation, including pulmonary edema, prolonged withdrawal, drug toxicity, withdrawal from cross-addiction to alcohol and benzodiazepines, variceal rupture, aspiration pneumonia, and death.CONCLUSIONS: The risks of this procedure are great and further studies should assess its safety and the novel use of naltrexone.",

    "title": "An extended-release formulation of oxybutynin chloride for the treatment of overactive urinary bladder.",
    "abstract": "Detrusor instability, or urinary incontinence, is common in elderly patients, particularly elderly women. The clinical symptoms of overactive, or unstable, urinary bladder include urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency. Mixed urinary incontinence, which comprises urge urinary incontinence and stress incontinence, is manifested by increased intraabdominal pressure on coughing or sneezing. The detrusor muscle of the bladder is under the control of the parasympathetic, or muscarinic, nervous system. The drug of choice in this condition is oxybutynin chloride, which has the ability to block acetylcholine released from parasympathetic nerves in the urinary bladder, preventing contractions of the muscle and exerting a direct spasmolytic effect on the bladder. A new extended-release oral tablet formulation, OROS oxybutynin, uses osmotic pressure to deliver the drug at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. It resembles a conventional tablet but has a two-part core consisting of a drug layer and below it, a \"push\" layer containing osmotically active components, the whole surrounded by a semipermeable membrane with a laser-drilled opening in the drug side. Water in the gastrointestinal tract enters the tablet and mixes with the drug to form a suspension. The \"push\" layer expands and pushes the suspended drug out of the orifice and into the gastrointestinal tract for eventual absorption. Pharmacokinetic studies have indicated a slow rise in mean plasma concentration of the isomer R-oxybutynin for 4 to 6 hours after a single dose of OROS oxybutynin, followed by maintenance of steady concentrations for up to 24 hours, minimizing the fluctuations between peak and trough associated with TID dosing of 5-mg immediate-release oxybutynin tablets. Efficacy and safety studies comparing the extended-release with the immediate-release formulation of oxybutynin demonstrated equivalent efficacy in patients with overactive urinary bladder. The adverse-event profile of oxybutynin is similar to that of a typical anticholinergic agent such as atropine--dry mouth, constipation, somnolence, blurred vision, headache, and gastrointestinal pain--although in 2 clinical studies, the incidence of dry mouth was less with the extended-release formulation. Once-daily dosing with OROS oxybutynin appears to be well tolerated and effective, as well as convenient, for the treatment of overactive bladder, particularly for elderly patients using multiple medications.",

    "title": "Oral 4-aminosalicylic acid versus 5-aminosalicylic acid slow release tablets. Double blind, controlled pilot study in the maintenance treatment of Crohn's ileocolitis.",
    "abstract": "4-Aminosalicylic acid (4-ASA) has been suggested as an effective treatment for both active and quiescent ulcerative colitis. 5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is well accepted for the maintenance treatment of inactive ulcerative colitis. Moreover, recent studies suggest that 5-ASA may also be effective in maintaining remission in Crohn's colitis. As treatment with 4-ASA may result in less side effects, the efficacy of a one year's maintenance treatment with oral 4-ASA (1.5 g/d, slow release tablets, n = 19) and oral 5-ASA (1.5 g/d, slow release tablets, n = 21) was compared in a double blind, randomised trial in patients with quiescent Crohn's ileocolitis. Patients with ileocolonic or colonic involvement were enrolled if in stable remission for more than two months but less than one year. Baseline demography and clinical severity were similar in both groups. Total colonoscopy and ileoscopy were performed at enrollment and at the end of the study. After one year seven of 19 patients receiving 4-ASA (36%) and 8 of 21 receiving 5-ASA (38%) had developed a clinical relapse, as defined by a rise in the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) of more than 100 points to values higher than 150. The relapse rates between the 4-ASA and the 5-ASA groups were not statistically different although no comparison with the spontaneous relapse rate in a placebo group could be made. Clinical relapse was accompanied by a statistically significant rise in serum concentrations of soluble interleukin 2 receptor and by an increased percentage of activated peripheral blood T cells. There were no statistical differences between the 4-ASA and the 5-ASA groups regarding the height of rise in CDAI or of soluble interleukin 2 receptor concentrations during relapse, thus showing a similar severity relapsed disease activity. In conclusion, 4-ASA maybe as effective as 5-ASA in the maintenance treatment of quiescent Crohn's disease and there were no differences in the severity of relapse between both treatment groups.",

Significant increases in mean interdose interval and per cent of the waking day spent \"on\", as well as reductions in the number of daily medication doses and number of \"off\" episodes were noted. In the double-blind part of the study, relative to open treatment with STD, ten patients rated themselves as improved while taking CR4, whereas only three considered themselves improved with STD. Difficulties using CR4 included an increased \"lag-time\" to the onset of antiparkinson effect, a tendency to produce increasingly severe dyskinesia late in the day, and a somewhat lessened predictability of motor response. Nonetheless, since the overall level of motor function through the day was equal to or better than that attained with STD, but with fewer medication administrations, Sinemet CR4 should prove a useful antiparkinsonian agent.",

    "abstract": "The hypoestrogenic state induced by gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of uterine leiomyomas but to induce bone loss. Estriol has been described to be a weak and short-acting estrogen without an increased risk of endometrial proliferation and hyperplasia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether treatment of uterine leiomyomata with GnRHa plus oral estriol add-back therapy could prevent bone loss, without deteriorating the therapeutic effect of GnRHa. Twelve premenopausal women with symptomatic uterine leiomyomas were randomized to receive either leuprolide acetate depot alone at a dose of 3.75 mg s.c. every month for 6 months (non add-back group; n = 6), or GnRHa for 6 months plus oral estriol 4 mg/day for 4 months commencing with the third GnRHa injection (add-back group; n = 6). In the add-back group, leiomyoma volume, as measured by transvaginal ultrasound, decreased to 59.1% of baseline at 2 months of GnRHa therapy with no significant change in size during the remaining treatment period. In contrast, it decreased to 31.3% of pretreatment size at the end of treatment in the non add-back group. The levels of bone metabolic markers such as CrossLaps, deoxypyridinoline, osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, increased significantly throughout the treatment in the non add-back group, whereas they were suppressed by the add-back therapy. The bone mineral density of lumbar spine (L2-L4) as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry decreased significantly by 7.5% at the end of treatment in the non add-back group, but did not change significantly in the add-back group. In conclusion, GnRHa plus estriol add-back therapy might be considered for long-term treatment of uterine leiomyomata.",

The study was of double-blind, parallel-group design and comprised a 2-week run-in on previous maintenance therapy followed by a 6-week study treatment period. There were 117 randomized asthmatic patients aged 20-70 years (65 women and 52 men with a mean age of 45 and predicted FEV1 of 64%), who had been taking 800-2000 micrograms inhaled steroid and/or up to 20 mg oral steroid per day for at least 4 weeks. They were asked to complete daily diary cards, recording morning and evening PEF, daily symptoms, nocturnal awakenings, rescue medication and subjective tremor. There was a significant increase in both morning and evening PEF respectively, on bambuterol (28 l min-1, 20 l min-1, P < 0.05) and salmeterol (29 l min-1, P < 0.001; 23 l min-1, P < 0.01) when compared with run-in. The mean percentage fall in overnight PEF was reduced by 8.3% (P < 0.001) on bambuterol and by 6.8% (P < 0.001) on salmeterol. Nocturnal awakenings and daytime symptoms due to asthma were significantly lowered by both treatments, as was the consumption of rescue bronchodilator. Tremor scores were very low during both run-in and study treatments. No significant treatment difference between bambuterol and salmeterol was detected for any of the above variables. Once-daily oral bambuterol provides a highly effective alternative to twice-daily inhaled salmeterol for relief of nocturnal symptoms in patients with moderate to severe asthma.",

For 4 weeks 14 patients were treated with 2.5 mg/kg/day cyclosporin A and 14 patients with placebo. Cyclosporin A but not placebo caused a significant decrease in clinical disease parameters. In contrast, no significant differences in delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions between treatment groups were observed.

The in vitro dissolution rate of TA-5707F in the second fluid from the former granules could be altered by changing the grade (HPMC-AS-M, AS-H, AS-V) or coating amount. However, the plasma concentration determined in fasted dogs was not markedly affected by the HPMC-AS grades. From the granules coated with 30% (w/w) AS-V (the polymer with the highest pH required for dissolution), little TA-5707F was released into the second fluid, but a fairly high plasma concentration was detected although a constant plasma level was not maintained in the fasted dogs. The dissolution rates from the double layer coated granules were changed by the coating percent of EC. The plasma concentration of TA-5707F in dogs correlated well with the in vitro dissolution rate and was not markedly affected by food. Thus, two kinds of double layer coated granules (coated 0.75% EC and 1% EC) were administered to humans, and showed sustained-releasing plasma profiles; that is, the plasma concentration increased gradually and reached a Cmax 5 and 8 h after administration, respectively. The amount of urinary excretion of TA-5707F and its metabolite was 70% of the dose. This value was almost equal to that of the rapid release tablet. In dogs the in vivo absorption rate was similar to the in vitro dissolution rate, but in humans it was only about half.",

N Engl J Med. 1994 Sep 29;331(13):873-4. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199409293311311.BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids are the most efficacious drugs for inducing remission in active Crohn's disease, but their benefits are frequently offset by serious side effects. Budesonide is a corticosteroid with high topical antiinflammatory activity but low systemic activity because of extensive hepatic metabolism. We investigated the efficacy and safety of an oral controlled-ileal-release preparation of budesonide in patients with active Crohn's disease involving the ileum or ileum and proximal colon.METHODS: In a double-blind, multicenter trial, 258 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or one of three doses of budesonide--3, 9, or 15 mg daily. The primary outcome measure was clinical remission, as defined by a score of 150 or less on the Crohn's disease activity index.RESULTS: After eight weeks of treatment, remission occurred in 51 percent of the patients in the group receiving 9 mg of budesonide (95 percent confidence interval, 39 to 63 percent), 43 percent of those receiving 15 mg (95 percent confidence interval, 31 to 55 percent), and 33 percent of those receiving 3 mg (95 percent confidence interval, 21 to 44 percent), as compared with 20 percent of those receiving placebo (P < 0.001, P = 0.009, and P = 0.13, respectively). Improvements in the quality of life, as measured by the patients' responses to the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire, paralleled these remission rates. Location of disease, prior surgical resection, and previous use of corticosteroids did not affect the outcome. A total of 119 patients (46 percent) were withdrawn from the study before the trial ended, 96 because of insufficient therapeutic effects, 13 because of adverse reactions, and 10 because of noncompliance. Budesonide caused a dose-related reduction in basal and corticotropin-stimulated plasma cortisol concentrations but was not associated with clinically important corticosteroid-related symptoms or other toxic effects.CONCLUSIONS: In an eight-week trial, an oral controlled-release preparation of budesonide at an optimal daily dose of 9 mg was well tolerated and effective against active Crohn's disease of the ileum and proximal colon.",

    "abstract": "A 52-year-old female with metastatic glucagonoma secreting glucagon and chromogranin A was treated with the somatostatin analogue octreotide for 2 years without any additional tumor-reducing interventions. Before therapy plasma glucagon was above 8 micrograms/l (normal < 0.2) and within 2 days 3 x 200 micrograms octreotide daily suppressed plasma glucagon to 2.2-2.5 micrograms/l. Concomitantly, chromogranin A dropped from 0.85 mg/l (normal < 0.1) to 0.2. After 3 weeks the preexisting disabling necrolytic migratory erythema had vanished completely, and weight loss was temporarily stopped. During therapy chromogranin A and plasma glucagon rose, exceeding pretreatment levels after 3 and 14 months, respectively. After 1 year the erythema recurred, responding only transiently to increasing doses of octreotide. The patient died after 2 years of therapy of tumor cachexy despite very high doses of octreotide (4 x 600 micrograms/day). Throughout treatment octreotide did not prevent tumor growth, as demonstrated by computed tomography and sonography. Determination of immunoreactive glucagon before and during octreotide therapy in fractions of plasma samples subjected to gel chromatography revealed a reduction in the ratio of glucagon to preproglucagon from 1.83 (before) to 0.56 (during therapy), indicating inhibition of posttranslational processing of preoproglucagon by octreotide, thereby reducing circulating bioactive glucagon. In summary, octreotide induced a remission of clinical symptoms by inhibiting posttranslational conversion of preproglucagon to glucagon but did not prevent tumor growth. Therefore, octreotide is a valuable therapy for rapid relief of clinical symptoms, thereby improving the possibilities for other tumor-reducing therapies.",

    "abstract": "Forty-five diabetic patients were randomly assigned to treatment with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), multiple injections (MI), and conventional insulin treatment (CIT). They were prospectively followed up for one year. A computerised scanning microdensitometer was applied on fundus photographs of retinal vessels, and we studied changes in calibres of the blood column (W0) and in width (Wr/W0) and intensity (Ir) of the central 'light reflex'. After six months of improved metabolic control the Ir was reduced in both MI and CSII cases compared with CIT cases (p less than 0.01), indicating haemorrheological changes in the retinas. Within these six months cotton-wool spots appeared in half the patients (n = 15) on CSII and MI, but not in CIT patients. Subjects who developed cotton-wool spots, compared with those who did not, had greater intensities of reflection and larger calibres of vessels at the start of the study (p less than 0.01). On intensifying the treatment they were characterised by a larger fall in hemoglobin A1 (p less than 0.01) and by a larger decrease in Ir on arteries (p less than 0.05) and veins (p less than 0.01). The behaviour of the retinal circulation is different in patients developing transient ischaemic lesions on intensified insulin treatment from its behaviour in those who do not.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy and safety of 0.05% halobetasol propionate ointment were evaluated in patients with chronic atopic or other eczematous dermatoses in two vehicle-controlled, double-blind studies: a paired-comparison study in 124 patients (study A) and a parallel-group study in 100 patients (study B). In study A, patients applied both treatments twice daily for 2 weeks and were evaluated by investigators on days 0, 7, and 14 with 0 to 3 severity scales and by self-assessment with two 5-step end-of-treatment rating scales. In study B, patients applied treatments twice daily for 2 weeks, and investigators made evaluations on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 with 0 to 6 scales and also made a 5-step end-of-treatment physician's global assessment. In study A, both severity scores and patient ratings favored halobetasol propionate significantly on days 7 (p less than or equal to 0.0013) and 14 (p less than 0.0001); in study B, severity scores on days 3 (p less than or equal to 0.045, pruritus, erythema, and overall lesion severity), 7, and 14 (p less than 0.001, all comparisons) also favored halobetasol propionate significantly, and global assessments showed complete resolution or marked improvement for 83% of patients using halobetasol propionate versus 28% of those using vehicle (p less than 0.0001). No instances of systemic effects or skin atrophy were reported in either study. We conclude that 0.05% halobetasol propionate ointment is highly effective and well tolerated in the treatment of the conditions studied, with the rapid action and high degree of clearing associated with superpotent corticosteroid formulations.",

    "abstract": "A 46-year-old woman with acromegaly and hyperthyroidism due to a pituitary adenoma. She had high serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and very high serum growth hormone (GH) levels. Transsphenoidal removal of the tumor, post-operative irradiation, frontal craniotomy for removal of residual tumor and large-dose bromocriptine therapy were carried out consecutively. After therapy, serum GH levels gradually decreased, but not to the normal range, and serum TSH levels remained at inappropriately normal levels. Using immunoperoxidase techniques, GH-, TSH- and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-containing cells were demonstrated in the adenoma. A long-acting somatostatin analogue (SMS 201-995, 600 micrograms/day) suppressed the serum GH level to the normal range with a concomitant suppression of TSH. Furthermore, the paradoxical serum GH responses to TRH and LH-RH were slightly improved. No important subjective side-effects were noted. Therefore, SMS 201-995 appeared to be a very effective drug in this patient with a GH- and TSH-producing pituitary tumor.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of hydrochlorothiazide, sustained release verapamil, and their combination in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.DESIGN: Randomised multicentre trial of 48 weeks' duration with a double blind comparison of hydrochlorothiazide and verapamil followed by an open trial of combined treatment for patients not achieving the target diastolic blood pressure (less than 90 mm Hg) during treatment with a single drug.SETTING: Outpatient departments in 10 clinics and 10 private practices of general practitioners or internists.PATIENTS: 369 Hypertensive patients with a diastolic blood pressure of 95-120 mm Hg during a placebo run in period of two weeks.INTERVENTIONS: Initial treatment consisted of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide (n = 187) or 120 mg sustained release verapamil (n = 182) once daily (regimen I). If the target diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg was not achieved within four weeks doses were increased to 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide or 240 mg verapamil once (regimen II) and twice daily (regimen III). Patients not achieving target blood pressure were given the combination of hydrochlorothiazide and verapamil--that is, 25 and 240 mg once (regimen IV) and twice daily (regimen V).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Blood pressure determined with a device permitting automatic repeated measurements with printouts.RESULTS: After eight weeks of treatment with a single drug 76 out of 178 (43%) and 101 out of 175 (58%) patients achieved the target blood pressure with hydrochlorothiazide and verapamil, respectively. During follow up until 48 weeks patients treated with verapamil reached the target blood pressure more often and at lower doses and were less likely to switch to combination treatment than patients randomised to hydrochlorothiazide treatment. Adding verapamil to hydrochlorothiazide was more effective than the addition of hydrochlorothiazide to verapamil. At the end of the study 42 out of 169 (25%) and 73 out of 163 (45%) patients initially randomised to hydrochlorothiazide and verapamil, respectively, were at target blood pressure without combination treatment. After adding verapamil to hydrochlorothiazide or hydrochlorothiazide to verapamil an additional 58 (34%) and 29 (18%) patients reached the target blood pressure, respectively. Altogether 92 out of 332 (28%) patients failed to achieve target blood pressure with regimen V. There were four, 10, seven, and seven withdrawals due to possible adverse effects to treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, verapamil, combining verapamil with hydrochlorothiazide, and combining hydrochlorothiazide with verapamil, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: In doses currently used in antihypertensive treatment verapamil was more effective than hydrochlorothiazide as a single agent and in combination in mild to moderate hypertension, whereas withdrawal rates caused by side effects possibly related to treatment were similar.",

Béclère, Clamart, France.PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eighty-two in vitro fertilization (IVF) candidates undergoing new or repeat IVF cycles at Hôpital A. Béclère over a 4-month period.TREATMENT: Group 1 (7-day protocol): A short-acting preparation of GnRH-a (Tripteriline 0.1) was administered daily for 7 days, starting on cycle day 2. Ovarian stimulation with hMG was started on cycle day 4. Group 2 (long protocol): A timed release preparation of GnRH-a (Tripteriline 3.75 mg) was administered on cycle day 2. Ovarian stimulation with hMG was started after documented ovarian suppression.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Response to COH, pregnancy rate (PR), tolerance.RESULTS: In the 7-day protocol, the amount of hMG required was markedly lower at 24 +/- 7 than in the long protocol group requiring 42.5 +/- 9.75 vials (75 IU) (mean +/- SD). No elevation of plasma LH occurred in either group. The number of oocytes retrieved was 7.3 +/- 1 and 10.7 +/- 1.2 (mean +/- SD) in the 7-day and long protocols, respectively. Yet, the number of embryos obtained and the PRs were similar in the two treatment groups.CONCLUSIONS: We observed that in COH, GnRH-a treatment could be interrupted safely several days before human chorionic gonadotropin administration without risking a premature increase of plasma luteinizing hormone. Moreover, the number of embryos available for fresh transfer and the ongoing PRs were similar in the new 7-day and in the classic long GnRH-a/hMG protocols, despite the smaller number of oocytes suggesting a greater efficiency of the 7-day protocol. The peak estradiol level and the hMG requirement were also lower in the 7-day GnRH-a/hMG protocol.",

    "abstract": "Comment in    J Am Coll Cardiol. 1996 Mar 15;27(4):951-2. doi: 10.1016/0735-1097(96)84779-6.OBJECTIVES: We examined the antianginal and anti-ischemic effects of oral zatebradine, a direct sinus node inhibitor that has no blood pressure-lowering or negative inotropic effects in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris taking extended-release nifedipine.BACKGROUND: Heart rate reduction is considered an important pharmacologic mechanism for providing anginal pain relief and anti-ischemic action in patients with chronic stable angina, suggesting a benefit for sinus node-inhibiting drugs.METHODS: In a single-blind placebo run-in, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, patients already receiving extended-release nifedipine (30 to 90 mg once a day) were randomized to receive zatebradine (5 mg twice a day [n = 64]) or placebo (n = 60). All subjects had reproducible treadmill exercise-induced angina at baseline, and after randomization they performed a serial exercise test 3 h after each dose for 4 weeks.RESULTS: Zatebradine reduced rest heart rate both at 4 weeks ([mean +/- SEM] 12.9 +/- 1.23 vs. 2.3 +/- 1.6 [placebo] beats/min, p < 0.0001) and at the end of comparable stages of Bruce exercise (16.7 +/- 1.2 vs. 3.4 +/- 1.2 [placebo] beats/min, p < 0.0001). Despite the significant effects on heart rate at rest and exercise, there were no additional benefits of zatebradine from placebo baseline in measurements of total exercise duration, time to 1-mm ST segment depression or time to onset of angina. Subjects taking zatebradine also had more visual disturbances as adverse reactions.CONCLUSIONS: Zatebradine seems to provide no additional antianginal benefit to patients already receiving nifedipine, and it raises questions regarding the benefit of heart rate reduction alone as an antianginal approach to patients with chronic stable angina.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the courses of absorption and the interindividual and intraindividual variations in absorption of iodine-125 labelled Ultratard HM and NovoSol Basal injected subcutaneously.DESIGN: Open randomised crossover study. Each patient was tested during two study periods of five days each, during which he or she received a subcutaneous injection of either 125I-NovoSol Basal or 125I-Ultratard HM on four consecutive days. The aim was to detect a reduction in intraindividual standard deviation by a factor of two with a probability 0.95, taking 0.05 as the level of significance. This required 24 degrees of freedom and led to the choice of four courses in each of eight patients.SETTING: Referrals to the diabetes research centre in Hvidøre, Copenhagen.PATIENTS: Eight insulin dependent (type I) diabetics with low or undetectable C peptide concentrations who were receiving a multiple insulin injection regimen. One patient withdrew immediately after recruitment.INTERVENTIONS: After an overnight fast patients received 96 nmol (16 IU insulin) of either 125I-NovoSol Basal or 125I-Ultratard HM injected subcutaneously into the thigh. To ensure that the insulin entered the subcutaneous fat at the same depth, ultrasonography was performed on each patient before the first injection. A different injection site on the thigh was used each day for four days in order to facilitate monitoring of the disappearance of four different depots in each patient.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Residual activity at the injection site was measured roughly every two hours throughout the day. No radioactivity measurements were performed overnight (10 pm till 8 am). The residual radioactivity after the injection on the first day (upper right thigh) was recorded for five days, that after the injection on the second day (upper left thigh) for four days, after the injection on the third day (lower right thigh) for three days, and after the last injection (lower left thigh) for two days.RESULTS: NovoSol Basal was absorbed according to first order kinetics with a mean t50% of 35.3 (SEM 1.4) hours; Ultratard HM was absorbed after a lag phase and the corresponding t50% was 25.5 (2.5) hours. The intraindividual variations in t50% were significantly smaller with NovoSol Basal than with Ultratard HM (18.4% v 44.5%; p less than 0.001). Interindividual variations, however, were not significantly different (25.2% v 36.9%; p = 0.38). The total variation in t50% was substantially smaller with NovoSol Basal than with Ultratard HM (20.3% v 42.8%).CONCLUSIONS: NovoSol Basal seems to be an appreciable advance over Ultratard HM as a soluble insulin preparation for obtaining reproducible 24 hour insulin concentrations in the blood",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the short term, isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) is considered to be therapeutically effective. The long-term effects of treatment with slow-release ISDN are less clear.HYPOTHESIS: The study was undertaken to investigate the effects of continuous, long-term dosing with oral slow-release ISDN on the incidence of cardiac events in patients with healed myocardial infarction (MI). The study was carried out in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle.METHODS: In all, 1.102 in- and outpatients, of either gender, with healed MI were randomly divided into groups treated with ISDN (n = 470) and not treated with ISDN (n = 632). Patients in the ISDN group received a continuous regimen of 20 mg of oral, long-acting ISDN three times a day, after meals. The mean observation period was 15.0 +/- 18.5 months. The primary endpoints were nonfatal and fatal recurrent MI, death from congestive heart failure, and sudden death.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of the patients in the ISDN and no-treatment groups; nevertheless, significantly more patients in the ISDN group experienced cardiac events. In the ISDN group, 35 patients (7.4%) experienced cardiac events during the observation period, versus only 28 patients (4.4%) in the no-treatment group (p < 0.05; odds ratio 1.74; 95% confidence interval 1.04-2.90).CONCLUSION: Continuous long-term dosing with oral, slow-release ISDN does not reduce and probably increases the incidence of cardiac events among patients with healed MI.",

    "title": "Morphological analysis of articular cartilage biopsies from a randomized, clinical study comparing the effects of 500-730 kDa sodium hyaluronate (Hyalgan) and methylprednisolone acetate on primary osteoarthritis of the knee.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Histomorphometric study on cartilage samples taken from osteoarthritic human knees before and 6 months after intraarticular injections of a specific fraction (500-730 kDa) of hyaluronan. The results obtained with hyaluronan were compared with the results of methylprednisolone acetate treatment.METHODS: Twenty-four subjects with primary osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee were considered. Eleven patients were treated with Hyaluronan (Hyalgan), 20 mg/2 ml once a week for 5 weeks) and 13 with methylprednisolone (Depo-Medrol, 40 mg/1 ml once a week for 3 weeks). At the time of baseline and after 6 months from the start of treatment, biopsies of cartilage were taken and processed for electron microscopy. Articular surface morphology, territorial matrix, chondrocyte number and ultrastructure were characterized by a set of morphometric parameters. Samples from 19 informed patients showing no arthroscopic sign of OA were also used for comparison.RESULTS: Six months after hyaluronan treatment a significant reconstitution of the superficial layer were observed together with an improvement in chondrocyte density and territorial matrix appearance. Furthermore, chondrocytes appeared significantly improved in their metabolism, as indicated by the increased extension of the synthetic structures and mitochondria with respect to the organelles having catabolic or storage functions. Hyaluronan treatment produced results that were significantly superior to those delivered with Methylprednisolone in almost all the morphometric estimators.CONCLUSIONS: These results cannot be explained simply by temporary restoration of the synovial fluid viscoelasticity, and provide further evidence that the specific fraction of hyaluronan used in this study is a useful tool in OA treatment, with a potential structure-modifying activity.Copyright 2001 OsteoArthritis Research Society International.",

    "title": "Effectiveness of delayed activated charcoal administration in simulated paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose.",
    "abstract": "AIMS: Oral activated charcoal is used to treat drug overdose and is effective at reducing drug absorption when administered within 1 h of drug ingestion. There are fewer data on efficacy when the delay is longer, as is the case in most drug overdoses. This study investigated the efficacy of activated charcoal at preventing paracetamol (acetaminophen) absorption after simulated overdose when administration was delayed between 1 and 4 h.METHODS: An open randomized-order four-way crossover study was performed in healthy volunteers comparing the effect of activated charcoal 50 g on the absorption of 3 g paracetamol tablets when administered after an interval of 1, 2 or 4 h or not at all. Plasma paracetamol concentrations were measured over 9 h after paracetamol ingestion using h.p.l.c. and areas under the curve between 4 and 9 h (AUC(4,9 h)) calculated as a measure of paracetamol absorption.RESULTS: Activated charcoal significantly reduced paracetamol AUC(4,9 h) when administered after 1 h (mean reduction 56%; 95% Confidence intervals 34, 78; P<0.002) or 2 h (22%; 6, 39; P<0.03) but not after 4 h (8%; -8, 24). When administered after 1 h activated charcoal reduced individual plasma paracetamol concentrations significantly at all times between 4 and 9 h after paracetamol administration. Administration at 2 or 4 h had no significant effect.CONCLUSIONS: These results in healthy volunteers cannot be extrapolated directly to poisoned patients. However, they provide no evidence of efficacy for activated charcoal when administered after an interval of more than 2 h.",

Reductions in fat oxidation correlated well (r2 = 0.970) with reductions in exercising heart rate, and probably reflected the degree of beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade.

N Engl J Med. 1994 Sep 29;331(13):873-4. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199409293311311.BACKGROUND: Patients with active Crohn's disease are often treated with corticosteroids, but the treatment has many side effects. Budesonide is a potent, well-absorbed corticosteroid, but because of a high rate of first-pass metabolism in the liver, its systemic bioavailability is low.METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, 10-week trial comparing the efficacy and safety of an oral controlled-release form of budesonide with the efficacy and safety of prednisolone in 176 patients with active ileal or ileocecal Crohn's disease (88 patients in each treatment group). The dose of budesonide was 9 mg per day for eight weeks and then 6 mg per day for two weeks. The dose of prednisolone was 40 mg per day for two weeks, after which it was gradually reduced to 5 mg per day during the last week.RESULTS: At 10 weeks, 53 percent of the patients treated with budesonide were in remission (defined as a score < or = 150 on the Crohn's disease activity index), as compared with 66 percent of those treated with prednisolone (P = 0.12). The mean score on the Crohn's disease activity index decreased from 275 to 175 in the budesonide group and from 279 to 136 in the prednisolone group (P = 0.001). Corticosteroid-associated side effects were significantly less common in the budesonide group (29 vs. 48 patients, P = 0.003). Two patients in the prednisolone group had serious complications (one had intestinal perforation and one an abdominal-wall fistula). The mean morning plasma cortisol concentration was significantly lower in the prednisolone group than in the budesonide group after 4 weeks (P < 0.001) and 8 weeks (P = 0.02) of therapy, but not after 10 weeks.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with active Crohn's disease, both controlled-release budesonide and prednisolone are effective in inducing remission. In this trial, prednisolone reduced scores on the Crohn's disease activity index more, whereas with budesonide there were fewer glucocorticoid-associated side effects and less suppression of pituitary-adrenal function.",

    "title": "Fate of oral enzymes in pancreatic insufficiency.",
    "abstract": "Oral pancreatic enzyme supplements, including those protected from gastric acidity by enteric coating, often achieve only partial correction of pancreatic steatorrhoea. To characterise the mechanisms involved in vivo, eight patients with steatorrhoea due to advanced pancreatic insufficiency and nine healthy controls were studied. Two sets of studies (small bowel intubation and five day faecal fat quantification) were randomly performed while patients were either on enteric coated pancreatin or equivalent placebo. A 260 cm long multilumen tube was used for double marker perfusion of two 20 cm segments located in the duodenum and in the ileum respectively. Luminal pH, flow, and trypsin and lipase activity outputs were measured at each segment for four hours postcibally. Placebo treated patients with pancreatic steatorrhoea had low enzyme outputs in the duodenal test segment and even lower outputs in the ileal segment. Pancreatin treatment significantly decreased steatorrhoea (p < 0.05) and increased luminal enzyme outputs (p < 0.05). The increase was much greater in the ileal than in the duodenal segment. Thus enteric coated pancreatin treatment abolished the normal gradient between postcibal duodenal and ileal lipase output. The results suggest that enteric coated pancreatin nearly corrects severe pancreatic steatorrhoea. The ingested lipase was utilised inefficiently, however, as luminal enzyme activity in the ileum was enhanced to a greater extent than in the duodenum, and consequently the absorptive potential of the small bowel was only partially utilised.",

The total diuretic/saluretic effect was only marginally lower (19 and 28% respectively, P less than 0.05) after CR compared with plain tablets although the fraction absorbed was markedly decreased (39 and 51% lower, respectively, P less than 0.05), estimated as urinary recovery of frusemide. The total diuresis of the two CR formulations did not differ although the urinary recovery was significantly different (P less than 0.05). 3. The diuretic effect vs frusemide excretion rate showed minimal counter-clockwise hysteresis after plain tablets while the CR formulations produced clockwise hysteresis indicating tolerance. 4. In agreement with the concept of efficiency, the higher diuretic/saluretic effect per amount of excreted frusemide may be a consequence of the slower output of frusemide in urine with the CR formulations compared with plain tablets. The major part of the pharmacological effect was produced with a higher efficiency after CR compared with plain tablets. It should be noted that the pharmacokinetics of a drug and its pharmacodynamic potency independently determine the total response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "title": "Membrane transport in the malaria-infected erythrocyte.",
    "abstract": "The malaria parasite is a unicellular eukaryotic organism which, during the course of its complex life cycle, invades the red blood cells of its vertebrate host. As it grows and multiplies within its host blood cell, the parasite modifies the membrane permeability and cytosolic composition of the host cell. The intracellular parasite is enclosed within a so-called parasitophorous vacuolar membrane, tubular extensions of which radiate out into the host cell compartment. Like all eukaryote cells, the parasite has at its surface a plasma membrane, as well as having a variety of internal membrane-bound organelles that perform a range of functions. This review focuses on the transport properties of the different membranes of the malaria-infected erythrocyte, as well as on the role played by the various membrane transport systems in the uptake of solutes from the extracellular medium, the disposal of metabolic wastes, and the origin and maintenance of electrochemical ion gradients. Such systems are of considerable interest from the point of view of antimalarial chemotherapy, both as drug targets in their own right and as routes for targeting cytotoxic agents into the intracellular parasite.",

    "title": "Suicide gene therapy: possible applications in haematopoietic disorders.",
    "abstract": "Although the treatment results for some forms of haematologic malignancies are excellent, especially for the childhood acute leukaemias, there is still a significant fraction of patients that will not benefit from the therapy available today. The identification of new techniques, such as gene therapy, may therefore be of great importance for future therapeutic applications. Suicide gene therapy is one of several gene therapeutic approaches to treat cancer. A suicide gene is a gene encoding a protein, frequently an enzyme, that in itself is nontoxic to the genetically modified cell. However, when a cell is exposed to a specific nontoxic prodrug, this is selectively converted by the gene product into toxic metabolites that kill the cell. The suicide gene most commonly employed, both in experimental and a clinical settings, is herpes simplex thymidine kinase (HSVtk). Some suicide gene products also induce a so-called 'bystander effect', i.e. a toxic effect on adjacent nongene modified tumour cells and sometimes also on more distant tumour cells. The bystander effect is most evident in tumour cells that have a high number of gap junctions, cellular channels build up by proteins called connexins. Many tumours, amongst them many haematological ones, have a low number of gap junctions. Therefore, it is important to develop gap junction independent drug delivery systems. Suicide gene technology may also be used for the ex vivo purging of tumour cells in bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell autografts or for inactivation of effector cells, such as antitumour T donor lymphocytes in allogeneic transplantation to prevent severe graft versus host reactions. New constructs, e.g. combining suicide genes and immune response enhancing genes or suicide genes and connexin inducing genes may further improve the value of suicide gene therapy.",

    "title": "Transcription factors as drug targets: opportunities for therapeutic selectivity.",
    "abstract": "Many traditional drugs target cell surface receptors. Medicinal chemists and pharmacologists have not ventured into the field of transcription regulation due to the fear that drugs that interfere with transcription regulation may not be selective or efficacious. The past 5 years have seen some exciting developments in the field of signal transduction in general, and transcription regulation in particular. Our understanding of mechanisms of regulated and basal transcription is advanced to a degree that it should be possible to selectively modulate a target gene directly. In this review we have argued that sufficient diversity exists in the combinatorial interplay of the transcription factors to offer opportunities for selective therapeutic intervention. We have focused our attention on transcriptional factors that play a role in three different therapeutic areas: osteoporosis, immune modulation, and cardiovascular diseases. Human estrogen receptor is considered as a model transcription factor. The role of estrogen in bone remodeling is discussed. Opportunities for tissue-specific modulation of estrogen receptors are described. For selective immune modulation, we have discussed the role of NF-AT (nuclear factors for activated T cells) transcription factors in interleukin-2 gene regulation. The last section focuses on the transcriptional mechanisms conferring tissue specificity in regulated expression of the apoAI gene, a major component of HDL, in liver. We have highlighted opportunities for rational development of transcription-based drugs useful for raising HDL plasma levels and atherosclerosis prevention.",

    "title": "Status epilepticus: risk factors and complications.",
    "abstract": "Status epilepticus is common and associated with significant mortality and complications. It affects approximately 50 patients per 100,000 population annually and recurs in >13%. History of epilepsy is the strongest single risk factor for generalized convulsive status epilepticus. More than 15% of patients with epilepsy have at least one episode of status epilepticus and low antiepileptic drug levels are a potentially modifiable risk factor. Other risks include young age, genetic predisposition, and acquired brain insults. Fever is a very common risk in children, as is stroke in adults. Mortality rates are 15% to 20% in adults and 3% to 15% in children. Acute complications result from hyperthermia, pulmonary edema, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiovascular collapse. Long-term complications include epilepsy (20% to 40%), encephalopathy (6% to 15%), and focal neurologic deficits (9% to 11%). Neuronal injury leading to temporal lobe epilepsy is probably mediated by excess excitation via activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors and consequent elevated intracellular calcium that causes acute necrosis and delayed apoptotic cell death. Some forms of nonconvulsive status epilepticus may also lead to neuronal injury by this mechanism, but others may not. Based on clinical and experimental observations, complex partial status epilepticus is more likely to result in neuronal injury similar to generalized convulsive status epilepticus. Absence status epilepticus is much less likely to result in neuronal injury, and complications because it may be mediated primarily through excess inhibition. Future research strategies to prevent complications of status epilepticus include the study of new drugs (including NMDA antagonists, new drug delivery systems, and drug combinations) to stop seizure activity and prevent acute and delayed neuronal injury that leads to the development of epilepsy.",

Trials compared inhaled steroids and oral prednisolone or prednisone; where the maximum dose for inhaled steroids was 2000 mcg/day and prednisolone 60 mg (on alternate days).DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent reviewers screened 1285 titles and abstracts from the electronic search, bibliography searches and other contacts. Of these, 10 trials met previously defined inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics, and outcome measures.MAIN RESULTS: All trials were small and no data could be pooled. Carry-over effects were present in at least one cross-over trial. Data from six trials produced the same pattern, in which prednisolone 7.5-12 mg/day appeared to be as effective as inhaled steroid 300-2000 mcg/day. In two trials, inhaled steroid 300-400 mcg/day was more effective than prednisolone 5 mg/day. All doses of inhaled steroid appeared to be more effective than alternate day doses of prednisolone up to 60 mg on alternate days. Side-effect data were reported too variably to permit comparisons. A 30% incidence was reported in one study in patients receiving prednisolone 5 mg/day, none were reported in patients on inhaled steroids.REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: A daily dose of prednisolone 7.5-10 mg/day appears to be equivalent to moderate-high dose inhaled corticosteroids. Side-effects may be present on low doses, so if there is no alternative to oral steroids, the lowest effective dose should be prescribed.",

    "title": "Levetiracetam: the preclinical profile of a new class of antiepileptic drugs?",
    "abstract": "Levetiracetam is a new antiepileptic drug (AED) devoid of anticonvulsant activity in the two classic screening models for AEDs, the maximal electroshock and pentylenetetrazol seizure tests in both mice and rats. This contrasts a potent seizure suppression in genetic and kindled mice and rats and against chemoconvulsants inducing partial seizures in rats. The highly selective action in \"epileptic\" animals distinguishes levetiracetam from classic and other new AEDs that have nearly equipotent effects in normal and \"epileptic\" animals. Levetiracetam induces minor behavioral alterations in normal and in kindled mice and rats. This results in an unusually high safety margin in animal models reflecting both partial and primary generalized epilepsy. Furthermore, experiments in the kindling model suggest that levetiracetam may possess antiepileptogenic properties due to a potent ability to prevent the development of kindling in mice and rats at doses devoid of adverse effects. Electrophysiologic recordings from different experimental models suggest that levetiracetam exerts a selective action against abnormal patterns of neuronal activity, which probably explains its selective protection in epileptic animals and its unique tolerability. This effect appears to derive from one or more novel mechanisms of action that do not involve a conventional interaction with traditional drug targets implicated in the modulation of inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission. Instead, ligand-binding assays have disclosed a brain-specific binding site for levetiracetam. These studies reveal a unique preclinical profile of levetiracetam, distinct from that of all known AEDs, suggesting that levetiracetam could represent the first agent in a new class of AEDs.",

    "title": "Pharmacogenomics: the promise of personalized medicine.",
    "abstract": "Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics deal with the genetic basis underlying variable drug response in individual patients. The traditional pharmacogenetic approach relies on studying sequence variations in candidate genes suspected of affecting drug response. On the other hand, pharmacogenomic studies encompass the sum of all genes, i.e., the genome. Numerous genes may play a role in drug response and toxicity, introducing a daunting level of complexity into the search for candidate genes. The high speed and specificity associated with newly emerging genomic technologies enable the search for relevant genes and their variants to include the entire genome. These new technologies have essentially spawned a new discipline, termed pharmacogenomics, which seeks to identify the variant genes affecting the response to drugs in individual patients. Moreover, pharmacogenomic analysis can identify disease susceptibility genes representing potential new drug targets. All of this will lead to novel approaches in drug discovery, an individualized application of drug therapy, and new insights into disease prevention. Current concepts in drug therapy often attempt treatment of large patient populations as groups, irrespective of the potential for individual, genetically-based differences in drug response. In contrast, pharmacogenomics may help focus effective therapy on smaller patient subpopulations which although demonstrating the same disease phenotype are characterized by distinct genetic profiles. Whether and to what extent this individual, genetics-based approach to medicine results in improved, economically feasible therapy remain to be seen. To exploit these opportunities in genetic medicine, novel technologies will be needed, legal and ethical questions must be clarified, health care professionals must be educated, and the public must be informed about the implications of genetic testing in drug therapy and disease management.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term effects of tolterodine on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients diagnosed with overactive bladder with incontinence.METHODS: Patients who completed a 12-week randomized, double-blind, safety and efficacy trial comparing tolterodine with placebo were invited to enroll in a 12-month open-label continuation trial to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of tolterodine. This study reports the HRQoL results from the King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) that were administered at baseline, at the end of the 12-week trial, and 3 and 12 months following open-label treatment with tolterodine.RESULTS: One thousand seventy-seven patients were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT(B)) population. KHQ translations were available for 838 patients (mean age, 61.1 years; 80.9% women) in the ITT(B) population. HRQoL, as measured by the KHQ, significantly improved from baseline to months 3 and 12 on the following domains: incontinence impact, role limitations, physical limitations, social limitations, personal relationships, emotions, sleep and energy, severity (coping) measures, and symptom severity. Improvements were generally consistent across all analyses for the 3- and 12-month measurements and for the ITT(B) and completer (C(B)) populations. Patients receiving tolterodine in the double-blind study showed additional improvement at the 3-month open-label assessment on all but the general health domain. At 12 months from treatment rollover, all improvements from rollover to 3 months were sustained with additional improvement seen on the incontinence impact and role limitations domains. The general health perceptions domain showed a slight decline from rollover that might be attributable to a natural decline in patients' health status at this life stage. These findings were consistent with other efficacy results whereby efficacy was maintained over the 12-month open-label period. SF-36 results were consistent with previous experience of reduced sensitivity, as population groups were similar to the SF-36 Physical Component and Mental Component scores at various time points and with all populations.CONCLUSION: Continued treatment with tolterodine provides additional benefits in HRQoL as measured by the KHQ. Of particular importance are improvements on the psychological aspects after longer-term treatment not detected after a short-term trial. Treatment effects on HRQoL are evident even after a 12-week placebo run-in supporting the true clinical effect of active treatment.",

Single photon emission tomography (SPET) was performed 2 h and 20 h after intravenous injection of autologous 99mTc-labelled LDL in four patients with untreated and five patients with recurrent glioma. 99mTc-LDL uptake was compared with the uptake of 99mTc-labelled human serum albumin (HSA), an established blood pool marker. The intra- and peritumoral distributions of radioactivity in the SPET images were not identical for radiolabelled LDL and HSA. The mean LDL tumour to brain ratio, determined from transversal SPET slices at 20 h post injection, was 1.5 in untreated and 2.2 in recurrent gliomas; the corresponding ratios for HSA were 1.6 and 3.4. The brain to blood ratio remained constant at 2 h and 20 h in both types of tumours. These data are not consistent with highly selective, homogeneous uptake of LDL in gliomas. However, the different tumoral distribution and rate of uptake of 99mTc-LDL, as compared with 99mTc-HSA, indicate that the uptake of LDL is different from that of HSA and that further studies on the mechanism of LDL uptake in glioma are warranted.",

Cisapride increased significantly both plasma concentrations of morphine after 1 h and peak concentrations. There was no significant change in time to peak concentrations, sedation scores or percentage decrease in pupil diameters. Plasma concentrations of amylase were increased in three patients in the MST-placebo group and three in the MST-cisapride group. One patient in the MST-cisapride group developed acute pancreatitis.",

    "title": "Control of severe pain with sustained-release morphine tablets v. oral morphine solution.",
    "abstract": "Recently a sustained-release morphine sulfate tablet (MS Contin [MSC]) was introduced in Canada. In a randomized double-blind crossover trial we compared MSC given every 12 hours with a morphine sulfate solution (MSS) given every 4 hours to 17 patients suffering from chronic severe pain. After titration of the morphine dosage to optimize the analgesic effect, each patient received 10 days of therapy with either MSC or MSS, then 10 days of therapy with an equal daily dose of the other formulation. Both preparations provided effective pain control, with minimal side effects. There was no significant difference between MSC and MSS in pain scores on a visual analogue scale (VAS), severity scores for tiredness and nausea, amount of supplemental morphine needed for break-through pain or patient preference. The plasma morphine concentrations tended to be greater during treatment with MSC. The study had an 89% probability of detecting a clinically significant difference in VAS pain scores. We conclude that an individualized, twice-daily regimen of MSC is as effective as MSS given every 4 hours for control of severe pain. The twice-daily regimen has several advantages: it provides for an uninterrupted night's sleep, it is substantially more convenient than the six doses per day required with MSS, and it should help reduce both medication errors and noncompliance.",

    "title": "Targeting the kinesin Eg5 to monitor siRNA transfection in mammalian cells.",
    "abstract": "RNA interference, the inhibition of gene expression by double-stranded RNA, provides a powerful tool for functional studies once the sequence of a gene is known. In most mammalian cells, only short molecules can be used because long ones induce the interferon pathway. With the identification of a proper target sequence, the penetration of the oligonucleotides constitutes the most serious limitation in the application of this technique. Here we show that a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the mRNA of the kinesin Eg5 induces a rapid mitotic arrest and provides a convenient assay for the optimization of siRNA transfection. Thus, dose responses can be established for different transfection techniques, highlighting the great differences in response to transfection techniques of various cell types. We report that the calcium phosphate precipitation technique can be an efficient and cost-effective alternative to Oligofectamine in some adherent cells, while electroporation can be efficient for some cells growing in suspension such as hematopoietic cells and some adherent cells. Significantly, the optimal parameters for the electroporation of siRNA differ from those for plasmids, allowing the use of milder conditions that induce less cell toxicity. In summary, a single siRNA leading to an easily assayed phenotype can be used to monitor the transfection of siRNA into any type of proliferating cells of both human and murine origin.",

    "title": "A randomized, multicenter prospective trial assessing long-acting release octreotide pamoate plus tamoxifen as a first line therapy for advanced breast carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Long-acting release octreotide pamoate (OP-LAR) is a synthetic octapeptide that can be administered monthly and whose activity is similar to that of endogenous somatostatin. In vitro and in vivo data suggest that OP-LAR may act as a growth inhibitor or a modulator of growth stimulatory peptides. The potential mechanisms of action of somatostatin analogues in breast carcinoma include the suppression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (a putative tumor growth factor) and the binding to the somatostatin receptors expressed by breast carcinoma cells in order to induce apoptosis.METHODS: This Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 203 patients (13% premenopausal and 87% postmenopausal) with locally recurrent (but unsuitable for local treatment) or metastatic breast carcinoma, 199 of whom were actually treated (99 patients with OP-LAR and 100 patients with placebo). All patients received TAM and were estrogen and/or progesteron receptor positive (receptor positivity was an eligibility criterion), and all had measurable or evaluable disease. Any patients who had received previous chemotherapy not given in an adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting were excluded.RESULTS: At the time of the interim analysis, the tumor response rates (RR) were 20.2% (9 complete responses [CR] and 11 partial responses [PR]) in the OP-LAR arm and 21% (11 CRs and 10 PRs) in the placebo arm, and the median time to progression (TTP) was 25.0 and 26.9 weeks (P = 0.62), respectively. The adverse events experienced by 10% or more of the patients and attributed to octreotide were gastrointestinal in nature: diarrhea (53%), nausea (16%), and abdominal pain (11%).CONCLUSIONS: Because of the similar RR and TTP in both arms, the trial was stopped at the interim analysis. The current data confirm there is no indication for adding somatostatin analogues to TAM in advanced breast carcinoma.",

    "title": "Can a controlled-release oral dose form of oxycodone be used as readily as an immediate-release form for the purpose of titrating to stable pain control?",
    "abstract": "Two separate trials compared controlled-release (CR) oral oxycodone (administered every 12 hours) with immediate-release (IR) oxycodone (4 times a day) to determine whether patients with chronic pain could be titrated to stable pain control as readily with the CR as with the IR formulation. In one study, 48 patients with cancer pain were randomized to open-label titration with either CR or IR oxycodone (maximum dose, 400 mg/day) for a period of up to 21 days. In a study of similar design, 57 patients with low back pain were titrated with either CR or IR oxycodone (maximum dose, 80 mg/day) for a period of up to 10 days. The majority of patients in both studies were converted to oxycodone from other opioid analgesics. Results of both studies showed no difference between CR and IR oxycodone with respect to both the percentage of patients achieving stable pain control, the time to achieve stable pain control, and the degree of pain control achieved. Among cancer patients, 85% achieved stable analgesia, 92% with the CR formulation and 79% with the IR formulation. Among noncancer patients, 91% achieved stable pain control, 87% with the CR formulation and 96% with the IR formulation. The most commonly reported adverse effects in both studies were similar for the two formulations and were those anticipated with opioids: nausea, vomiting, constipation, somnolence, dizziness, and pruritus. Nausea and vomiting were the most frequently cited reasons for treatment discontinuations. These studies suggest that dose titration can be accomplished as readily with oral CR oxycodone as with IR oxycodone in patients with chronic, moderate to severe pain.",

    "title": "Modulation of ventricular rate in permanent atrial fibrillation: randomized, crossover study of the effects of slow-release formulations of gallopamil, diltiazem, or verapamil.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The management of permanent atrial fibrillation (PAF) consists primarily of long-term anticoagulation with either aspirin or warfarin to prevent systemic embolization, and modulation of ventricular rate (VR) to improve cardiac function by prolonging the ventricular diastolic filling time.HYPOTHESIS: The effects of slow-release formulations of gallopamil (100 mg b.i.d.), diltiazem (120 mg b.i.d.), or verapamil (120 mg b.i.d.) on VR were evaluated in 18 patients with PAF without organic heart disease.METHODS: In all patients, each treatment was administered randomly, was compared with oral digoxin, and was assessed by 24-h Holter monitoring during daily life and by a 6-min walking test.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in mean and minimum VR recorded during 24-h Holter monitoring among the four treatments. Peak heart rates recorded during the 6-min walking test with digoxin treatment was 167 +/- 12 beats/min. This was significantly reduced by gallopamil (149 +/- 23 beats/min, p = 0.01), diltiazem (142 +/- 24 beats/min, p < 0.001), and verapamil (137 +/- 30 beats/min, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in peak VR during the walking test among the three calcium antagonists. Pauses of > 3 s were observed in 3 of 18 (17%) patients who received digoxin (max 3.4 s) and in 5 of 18 (28%) patients who received diltiazem (max 3.4 s); p = NS. Periods of bradycardia < 30 beats/min were observed in 5 of 18 (28%) patients during digoxin treatment, and in 3 of 18 (17%) patients during treatment with gallopamil, diltiazem, and verapamil; p = NS.CONCLUSION: Gallopamil, diltiazem, or verapamil are superior to digoxin in controlling VR during mild exercise in patients with PAF without organic heart disease. The reduction of peak VR is obtainable without further slowing of resting VR. However, gallopamil appears to be the least effective calcium blocker at controlling resting and exercise VR; thus, there are no advantages over the other calcium blockers in its use in the clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "In this multicentre study a controlled-release formulation of levodopa and the decarboxylase inhibitor benserazide (Madopar CR) was evaluated in patients with Parkinson's disease exhibiting dose-related fluctuations in motor performance in response to conventional levodopa preparations. The effect of Madopar CR, with or without conventional levodopa/benserazide, on the proportion of time spent \"on\", \"off\" or \"intermediate\" was compared with that of previous conventional levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor therapy. Evaluation of the two periods of optimum therapy was based on both patient diary data and investigator opinion. Forty seven patients completed the study but full patient diaries were available for only 37. The mean optimum total daily dosage of conventional Madopar was 820 mg taken in a mean of 6.4 doses, compared with a mean optimum daily dosage of combined Madopar CR and conventional Madopar of 1088 mg, taken in a mean of 5.2 doses. Conventional Madopar was taken in addition to Madopar CR in all but eight patients. Madopar CR was felt to be advantageous in 83% and disadvantageous in 11% of patients completing the study. Considering the 37 patients for whom diary data were available, Madopar CR therapy resulted in an increase in the mean time spent \"on\" (p = 0.016) and a decrease in the mean time spent \"off\" (p = 0.029) compared with conventional Madopar alone. Individually 25 out of 37 had an increase in \"on\" time and 19 out of 37 experienced a decrease in \"off\" time. Thus Madopar CR was found to be beneficial in a significant proportion of patients experiencing fluctuations in response to conventional levodopa.",

We have therefore compared sulphasalazine, low dose mesalazine and high dose mesalazine in the treatment of mild to moderate relapse of ulcerative colitis. Sixty one patients (32 men, aged 20-78 years) were randomly allocated to sulphasalazine 2 g daily, mesalazine 800 mg daily, or mesalazine 2.4 g daily in a double blind, double dummy, four week trial. Groups were comparable for age, sex, extent of disease, and pretrial sulphasalazine intake. Four patients were unable to complete the study because of treatment failure (two taking sulphasalazine and two high dose mesalazine). A further two patients taking sulphasalazine developed side effects necessitating withdrawal. Within treatment comparisons revealed significant improvement of: sigmoidoscopic grade in the sulphasalazine group; rectal bleeding, sigmoidoscopic and histological grade in the low dose mesalazine group; stool frequency, rectal bleeding and sigmoidoscopic grade in the high dose mesalazine group. Greater improvement in rectal bleeding (p less than 0.05) and sigmoidoscopic appearances (p less than 0.05) occurred in patients taking high dose mesalazine than in those taking sulphasalazine. In two patients taking high dose mesalazine minor rises of plasma creatinine concentrations occurred, suggesting the need to monitor renal function.",

Patients (81% female) received oral therapy with tolterodine ER (n = 507) or placebo (n = 508) for 12 weeks.OUTCOMES MEASURED: HRQoL was assessed using the King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-item questionnaire (SF-36). Patients also rated their bladder condition. Assessments were performed at baseline and at the end of treatment.RESULTS: At end of treatment, KHQ domains selected a priori as primary HRQoL end points (incontinence impact and role limitations) significantly improved (P < or = .001) with tolterodine ER. Domains selected a priori as secondary end points (physical limitations, sleep and energy, severity [coping] measures, and symptom severity) were also significantly improved (P < or = .006) following treatment with tolterodine ER. The tolterodine ER group had decreased symptom severity and statistically significant improvements in patient rating of bladder control compared with the placebo group at end of treatment. No treatment differences were detected using the SF-36.CONCLUSION: Many aspects of HRQoL, as measured by the KHQ, showed statistically significant improvement following treatment with tolterodine ER. These HRQoL improvements were consistent with clinical efficacy benefits. Patients receiving tolterodine ER experienced overall improvement in their condition that was associated with an important impact on their HRQoL.",

Polyethylene glycol-coated (pegylated) liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) has long circulation time and enhanced drug accumulation in the tumor tissues. It has significant activity in Kaposi's sarcoma, breast and ovarian cancers and the acute adverse effects of free drug are reduced.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A patient with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma was treated with PLD and a pharmacokinetic study was performed. Initial serum total and direct bilirubin were 3.6 and 6.8 folds of upper normal, respectively, and an indocyanine green clearance test at 15 minutes was 26.3% (normal < 15%).RESULTS: Compared to cases with normal liver function, increased volume of distribution of doxorubicin correlated with a large amount of ascites (P < 0.05). The clearance of drug was unexpectedly higher than in cases with normal liver function (P < 0.05). According to the pharmacokinetic studies, the disposition of PLD in this case has not been retarded even in the presence of severe liver dysfunction. Only minimal toxicities including grade 2 stomatitis and moderate leukopenia were observed. The tumor had a partial remission and the patient survived nine months after PLD treatment.CONCLUSION: PLD could serve as a safe and effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma even in the presence of impaired liver function. Its role in treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma is worthy of further study.",

In this seven year Oslo study 45 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients were initially randomized into three different modes of treatment: continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), multiple injections, or two injections a day. After four years, the patients were free to choose their treatment, and therefore the data were analyzed according to mean HbA1 during seven years. The mean HbA1 was 11.2% (2.2) (SD) at start, and 9.5% (1.5) at seven years, which was a significant long-term improvement (P less than 0.001). Eight out of 10 patients with mean seven year HbA1 less than 8.5% improved their albumin excretion rate, and patients with mean HbA1 greater than 10% had an increased albumin excretion rate (from 26 mg/24 hr to 91 mg/24 hr, P less than 0.02). The glomerular filtration rate decreased slightly regardless of mean HbA1 level. Systolic blood pressure increased significantly regardless of mean HbA1. Diastolic blood pressure was unchanged in the patients with mean HbA1 less than 10%, but increased slightly (NS) in patients with HbA1 greater than 10%. We conclude that mean blood glucose as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin is a main determinant in the progression of urinary albumin excretion in insulin dependent diabetics, and near normoglycemia improves urinary albumin excretion.",

The addition of the lower dose of nifedipine to atenolol did not significantly alter the weekly consumption of glyceryl trinitrate or the mean number of anginal attacks as assessed by diary cards. However, 2 h after dosing there was a significant prolongation during stress testing in the time to onset of both 1 mm ST depression on the ECG (by 28%) and to angina (by 37%) compared with atenolol alone, but no benefit was apparent by 12 h after dosing. 3. At a dose of 40 mg twice daily, nifedipine significantly reduced glyceryl trinitrate consumption by 25% and the number of anginal attacks by 36%. The times to onset of ST depression and angina were increased by 37% and 55% respectively at 2 h and by 24% and 26% respectively 12 h after dosing. 4. Analysis of the frequency distribution of anginal attacks showed decreasing efficacy with time after administration of nifedipine. The overall results also suggest a relationship between efficacy and the plasma nifedipine concentration, with a mean 20% improvement in time to development of angina occurring at a nifedipine plasma concentration of approximately 30-40 ng ml-1. 5. In conclusion, the reduction of effort-related angina by nifedipine is related to its plasma concentration and the effective duration of action of the 20 mg slow release formulation is less than 12 h.",

    "title": "Steady-state pharmacokinetic comparison of a new, extended-release, once-daily morphine formulation, Avinza, and a twice-daily controlled-release morphine formulation in patients with chronic moderate-to-severe pain.",
    "abstract": "Extended-release morphine formulations are widely used in the management of chronic pain. Avinza (morphine sulfate extended-release [MSER, Morphelan]) is a new, once-a-day, extended-release morphine formulation designed to reach target concentrations rapidly and maintain concentrations throughout a 24-hour period. The primary objective of this study was to compare the 24-hour steady-state pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of morphine and its metabolites (morphine-6-glucuronide [M6G] and morphine-3-glucuronide [M3G]) following ingestion of MSER once-a-day and MS Contin (controlled-release morphine sulfate [CRM]) twice-a-day in patients with chronic moderate-to-severe pain. Ten patients with chronic moderate-to-severe pain were recruited into an open-label, multiple-dose, nonrandomized, two-period, single-center study. All patients were stabilized for a minimum of 7 days on a twice-daily dose of CRM associated with an optimal balance between pain control and side effects. Patients were then switched to the closest equivalent once-daily dose of MSER for a minimum of 10 days. Twenty-four hour steady-state PK profiles were obtained on the last day of each treatment period and additional clinical and safety assessments were performed. PK data were normalized to a 100-mg total daily dose prior to statistical analysis. Nine of the 10 patients completed the entire study. MSER and CRM demonstrated similar bioavailability (AUC) of morphine and its metabolites. Compared to CRM, MSER demonstrated a 19% lower maximum concentration (C(max)), a 66% higher minimum concentration (C(min)), and a 44% lower peak-to-trough fluctuation (%FI) over the 24-hour period. In addition, MSER maintained concentrations above 50% and 75% of the C(max) longer than CRM. Clinical efficacy and safety were comparable for MSER and CRM. Once-daily MSER approaches maximum morphine concentration more quickly, approximates maximum concentration longer, and demonstrates less fluctuation in morphine concentration during a 24-hour period than CRM dosed twice daily. The pharmacodynamic implications of this profile deserve further study.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy and complications of the use of an intraocular sustained-release ganciclovir implant for the treatment of active cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in AIDS patients. Thirty-nine eyes of 26 patients were submitted to ocular surgery. All patients underwent complete ocular examination before and after surgery. The surgical procedure was always done under local anesthesia using the same technique. The mean time for the surgical procedure was 20 min (range, 15 to 30 min). The average follow-up period was 3.7 months. Of all patient, only 4 presented recurrence of retinitis after 8, 8, 9 and 2 months, respectively. Three of them received a successful second implant. All 39 eyes of the 26 patients presented healing of retinitis as shown by clinical improvement evaluated by indirect binocular ophthalmoscopy and retinography. Retinitis healed within a period of 4 to 6 weeks in all patients, with clinical regression signs from the third week on. Six (15.4%) eyes developed retinal detachment. None of the patients developed CMV retinitis in the contralateral eye. The intraocular implant proved to be effective in controlling the progression of retinitis for a period of up to 8 months even in patients for whom systemic therapy with either ganciclovir or foscarnet or both had failed. The intraocular sustained-release ganciclovir implant proved to be a safe new procedure for the treatment of CMV retinitis, avoiding the systemic side effects caused by the intravenous medications and improving the quality of life of the patients.",

    "title": "Doxazosin GITS compared with doxazosin standard and placebo in patients with mild hypertension.",
    "abstract": "Doxazosin, an effective treatment for mild-to-moderate hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia, in its standard formulation requires a multiple-step titration regimen to minimize the potential for first-dose effects. A new controlled-release gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation of doxazosin was developed to enhance the pharmacokinetic profile, significantly reducing serum peak-to-trough ratios, thereby minimizing the need for titration. We assessed the efficacy and tolerability of doxazosin GITS compared with doxazosin standard and placebo in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-titration, multicenter study of 392 patients with mild hypertension (blood pressure [BP] < or = 180/95-105 mmHg). Patients were randomized to doxazosin GITS, doxazosin standard, or placebo in 2:2:1 manner. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients in the per-protocol analysis (PPA) who achieved goal BP response (sitting BP < or = 90 mmg or 10 mmHg decrease from baseline at 24 h postdose at the final evaluable visit). Goal BP response in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and prespecified BP and/or heart rate changes in the PPA and/or ITT population were also analyzed. Tolerability was assessed throughout the study. Doxazosin GITS and doxazosin standard produced comparable goal BP responses superior to that of placebo, with 92 of 156 patients (59.0%) on doxazosin GITS and 86 of 152 patients (56.6%) on doxazosin standard in the PPA population achieving goal BP response 24 hours postdose on the final visit, compared with 25 of 70 patients (35.7%) on placebo. Both active treatments produced mean significant BP reductions compared with baseline and placebo (p < 0.001). The most commonly reported side effects were headache, dizziness, and asthenia. No syncope was reported in the doxazosin GITS group; two cases were observed in the doxazosin standard group and one case in the placebo group. Doxazosin GITS was well tolerated and as effective as doxazosin standard in patients with mild hypertension, producing well-tolerated, comparable BP reductions with minimal need for titration. Both active treatments were clinically and statistically superior to placebo.",

    "title": "Chemotherapy targeting regional lymph nodes by gastric submucosal injection of liposomal adriamycin in patients with gastric carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "We investigated the delivery of adriamycin (ADR) to the regional lymph nodes of the stomach following the gastric submucosal injection of liposomal adriamycin (Lipo-ADR) in 34 gastric carcinoma patients, as well as following intravenous administration of free ADR (F-ADR) in another 18 patients. Prior to radical gastrectomy, Lipo-ADR was endoscopically injected into the gastric submucosa adjacent to the primary tumor via a needle-tipped catheter. After Lipo-ADR injection, the ADR concentration in the primary and secondary drainage lymph nodes was higher than in the other regional lymph nodes. Thus, the regional nodes more susceptible to metastasis showed higher levels of ADR. In contrast, the intravenous administration of F-ADR produced a similar and far lower ADR concentration in all the nodes. Delivery of ADR to the primary drainage lymph nodes following injection of 5 ml of Lipo-ADR was compared with delivery to the left gastric artery lymph nodes after intravenous administration of an equal dose of F-ADR. The ADR levels (micrograms/g) after gastric submucosal injection were 15.1 +/- 8.30 on day 1 (n = 4); and 11.9 +/- 4.80 on day 4 (n = 6). Those after intravenous administration were 0.29 +/- 0.10 on day 1 (n = 4); and 0.36 +/- 0.0 on day 4 (n = 2). The differences between the two groups were significant (P < 0.05). The ADR levels after the gastric submucosal injection were far higher than those after intravenous administration. These findings indicate that the gastric submucosal injection of Lipo-ADR can specifically deliver ADR to the regional lymph nodes at high concentrations. Such preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy targeting the regional lymph nodes may be useful for preventing the lymph node recurrence of gastric carcinoma.",

Symptomatic response to this progestogen supplementation or placebo was assessed objectively by clinical examination and subjectively by linear analogue scales and breast pain charts. No significant relief of pain or tenderness was found on placebo or active treatment, irrespective of treatment order, and breast nodularity was similarly unaltered. No evidence of progesterone deficiency or prolactin abnormality was found. Side-effects were incurred in 11 patients (five on placebo, five on active treatment and one while on both) and were mostly vague premenstrual symptoms. We conclude that the therapeutic response of medroxyprogesterone acetate in cyclical mastalgia is no better than placebo and that progestogen supplementation can no longer be recommended for routine use in the management of breast pain.",

The antineoplastic drug camptothecin was linked to a water-soluble polymeric backbone (MAG-CPT) and administrated as a 30 min infusion over 3 consecutive days every 4 weeks to patients with malignant solid tumours. The objectives of our study were to determine the maximal tolerated dose, the dose-limiting toxicities, and the plasma and urine pharmacokinetics of MAG-CPT, and to document anti-tumour activity. The starting dose was 17 mg m(-2) day(-1). Sixteen patients received 39 courses at seven dose levels. Maximal tolerated dose was at 68 mg m(-2) day(-1) and dose-limiting toxicities consisted of cumulative bladder toxicity. MAG-CPT and free camptothecin were accumulated during days 1-3 and considerable amounts of MAG-CPT could still be retrieved in plasma and urine after 4-5 weeks. The half-lives of bound and free camptothecin were equal indicating that the kinetics of free camptothecin were release rate dependent. In summary, the pharmacokinetics of camptothecin were dramatically changed, showing controlled prolonged exposure of camptothecin. Haematological toxicity was relatively mild, but serious bladder toxicity was encountered which is typical for camptothecin and was found dose limiting.",

The value of this genomic database is that new proteins can be recognized to use as diagnostic markers, novel drug targets, and to better understand the physiology of this organism. However, similar to what has been observed in other sequenced bacterial genomes, approximately one third of the potential proteins have no known function. This is somewhat surprising given the long-standing interest in P. aeruginosa as an opportunistic pathogen. Obviously new tools, in addition to sequence similarity analysis, are needed to determine the role of these proteins. Proteomics using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry to detect and identify P. aeruginosa proteins represents a novel approach to address this gap.",

    "abstract": "The activity of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels is highly regulated by neurotransmitter receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins. In the expression studies using cloned Ca2+ channel subunits, it has been clarified that the main mechanism of the inhibition of N-type channel current is mediated directly by G-protein betagamma subunits in a membrane-delimited and voltage-sensitive manner. In addition, recent studies have also clarified that N-type channels are modulated by several G-protein alpha subunits in different ways. Among them, G(alpha o) mediates a voltage-resistant inhibition of N-type current by neurotransmitters. This type of inhibition is more apparent in the case of P/Q-type channels in both native cells and expression systems. Moreover, other G-protein subunits, such as G(alpha q) and G(alpha s), also seem to regulate N-type channels in a membrane-delimited manner. The fine tunings of Ca2+ channel activity by intracellular proteins have physiological and pathological meanings in the regulation of Ca2+ influx into excitable cells by neurotransmitters and pharmacological implications as novel drug targets for controlling Ca2+ influx.",

    "abstract": "Clinically important genetic polymorphisms influencing drug metabolism and drug response have typically been discovered on the basis of phenotypic differences among individuals from different populations. Routine genotyping before drug therapy may enable the identification of responders, nonresponders, or patients at increased risk of toxicity. Automated, high-throughput detecting methods for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are highly desirable in many clinical laboratories. The aim of this study is to develop a high-throughput genotyping method for detecting SNPs influencing drug response in the Japanese population. We have developed three real-time PCR assays for detecting SNPs in the human drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug targets. The assay for simultaneously detecting CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C18, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A5, NAT2, TPMT, DPYD, UGT1A1, ALDH2, ADH2, MDR1, CETP, DCP-1, ADRB2, HTR2A, INPP1, SDF1, and mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms takes less than 1.5 h. With the clinical application of NAT2 genotyping, we found statistically significant difference between the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and the NAT2 genotype. The incidence of the ADRs was significantly higher in the slow type than the in other two types, as 5 of the 6 patients were of the slowtype, and the other was the intermediatetype, while no patients of the rapidtype has developed any ADRs.",

    "abstract": "The host-fungus interaction is characterized by changes in gene expression in both host and pathogen. Differential-display reverse transcription PCR (DDRT-PCR) is a PCR-based method that allows extensive analysis of gene expression among several cell populations. Several limitations and drawbacks to this procedure have now been addressed, including the large number of false-positive results and the difficulty in confirming differential expression. Modifications that simplify the reaction time, allow the use of minute quantities of RNA, or address unusual species- or gene-specific sequences have been reported. DDRT-PCR has been used to address biological questions in mammalian systems, including cell differentiation, cell activation, cell stress, and identification of drug targets. In microbial pathogenesis and plant pathogenesis, DDRT-PCR has allowed the identification of virulence factors, genes involved in cell death, and signaling genes. In Candida albicans, DDRT-PCR studies identified TIF-2, which may play a role in the upregulation of phospholipases, and the stress-related genes, CIP1 and CIP2. In Histoplasma capsulatum and C. albicans, genes involved in the host-pathogen interaction, including a member of the 100-kDa family in Histoplasma and an ALS and 14-3-3 gene in Candida, were potentially identified by DDRT-PCR. Although very few reports have been published in medical mycology, studies in mammalian, nonfungal microbial, and plant pathogen systems are easily applied to basic questions in fungal pathogenesis and antifungal therapeutics.",

RGS proteins can accelerate the deactivation of G proteins by 1000-fold and in cell systems they profoundly inhibit signaling by many receptors, including mu-opioid receptors. Coupled with the known dynamic regulation of RGS protein expression and function, they are of obvious interest in understanding tolerance and dependence mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Biological diversity reflects an underlying molecular diversity. The molecules found in nature may be regarded as solutions to challenges that have been confronted and overcome during molecular evolution. As our understanding of these solutions deepens, the efficiency with which we can discover and/or design new treatments for human disease grows. Nature assists our drug discovery efforts in a variety of ways. Some compounds synthesized by microorganisms and plants are used directly as drugs. Human genetic variations that predispose to (or protect against) certain diseases may point to important drug targets. Organisms that manipulate molecules within us to their benefit also may help us to recognize key biochemical control points. Drug design efforts are expedited by knowledge of the biochemistry of a target. To supplement this knowledge, we screen compounds from sources selected to maximize molecular diversity. Organisms known to manipulate biochemical pathways of other organisms can be sources of particular interest. By using high throughput assays, pharmaceutical companies can rapidly scan the contents of tens of thousands of extracts of microorganisms, plants, and insects. A screen may be designed to search for compounds that affect the activity of an individual targeted human receptor, enzyme, or ion channel, or the screen might be designed to capture compounds that affect any step in a targeted metabolic or biochemical signaling pathway. While a natural product discovered by such a screen will itself only rarely become a drug (its potency, selectivity, bioavailability, and/or stability may be inadequate), it may suggest a type of structure that would interact with the target, serving as a point of departure for a medicinal chemistry effort--i.e., it may be a \"lead.\" It is still beyond our capability to design, routinely, such lead structures, based simply upon knowledge of the structure of our target. However, if a drug discovery target contains regions of structure homologous to that in other proteins, structures known to interact with those proteins may prove useful as leads for a medicinal chemistry effort. The specificity of a lead for a target may be optimized by directing structural variation to specificity-determining sites and away from those sites required for interaction with conserved features of the targeted protein structure. Strategies that facilitate recognition and exploration of sites at which variation is most likely to generate a novel function increase the efficiency with which useful molecules can be created.",

    "title": "Long-term treatment of asthmatic patients with salmeterol vs slow-release theophylline.",
    "abstract": "The aim of the present multicentre, open, randomized, parallel group study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of salmeterol versus theophylline in asthmatic patients. A total of 112 patients were randomized: 56 received inhaled salmeterol (50 micrograms twice daily) and 50 oral dose titrated theophylline twice daily. The study lasted 12 months. The efficacy of both drugs was evaluated for the first 3 months of the study and the safety for a further 9 months. Spirometric measurements were carried out for the total duration of the study. Salmeterol showed a greater and more significant efficacy than theophylline in reducing both day- and night-time symptoms (P < 0.001) and in reducing additional salbutamol requirement (P < 0.001). The subjective assessment of efficacy by physicians and patients was in favour of salmeterol from the first month of treatment (P < 0.001). Both drugs improved the quality of life as measured by the specific questionnaire 'Living with Asthma' with no significant differences. The total number of adverse events was slightly higher in the theophylline group compared with salmeterol (18 vs 9; P n.s.). Both salmeterol and theophylline increased morning and evening PEFR with no significant difference. FEV1 and FVC increased in both groups of patients; the difference between the effects of the two treatment was not statistically significant at 12 months. Our study suggests that salmeterol has higher efficacy and safety than theophylline in long-term treatment of asthmatic patients.",

    "abstract": "It has been recognized recently that theophylline possesses anti-inflammatory effects that could be of clinical interest in patients with airway inflammatory diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR). The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of theophylline on the nasal eosinophilic inflammatory response following allergen challenge in patients with AR. Fourteen subjects suffering from seasonal rhinitis with an early reaction after nasal allergen provocation were challenged outside the pollen season after pretreatment for 3 weeks with placebo or slow-release theophylline (Euphylong in a randomized double-blind, cross-over study. Nasal blocking index (NBI), nasal airway resistance and symptoms were recorded before, and 1 and 5 h after challenge; additionally, nasal lavage fluid was collected before, as well as 1 and 5 h after challenge. Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) was measured in the lavage as well as the number of eosinophils before, and 1 h and 5 h after allergen challenge. After 3 weeks of treatment, baseline concentrations of ECP in nasal lavage amounted to 826+/-329 ng x L(-1) (placebo) and 936+/-351 ng x L(-1) (theophylline). The ECP levels did not increase during the early phase response. Five hours after challenge, ECP in the placebo group increased markedly (p<0.01), whereas no significant increase was observed during theophylline treatment. In parallel, the number of eosinophils in the nasal lavage fluid was lower during theophylline treatment. Additionally, theophylline therapy also significantly reduced the nasal symptoms and had some protective effect against nasal obstruction following allergen challenge. These results confirm the anti-inflammatory effects of theophylline and suggest that these effects may be of clinical benefit in patients with allergic rhinitis.",

    "title": "Treatment of hypogonadal adolescent boys with long acting subcutaneous testosterone pellets.",
    "abstract": "AIMS: Long acting subcutaneous testosterone pellets are of proved efficacy for the treatment of hypogonadal men, but have not been reported as a treatment modality in adolescent boys. Pharmacodynamic studies of subcutaneous testosterone release have shown prolonged normalisation of testosterone levels for at least four months. Administration of a long acting, safe, effective, and convenient form of treatment is desirable when life-long treatment is indicated.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen boys (aged 13.9-17.5 years at the start of treatment)-seven with primary hypogonadism, nine with secondary hypogonadism, and two boys being treated with testosterone for tall stature--were given testosterone pellets (8-10 mg/kg) every six months for 18 months. Height, weight, pubertal status, and psychosocial parameters were assessed and follicle stimulating hormone, luteinising hormone, testosterone, prolactin, and lipids were measured at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months. Bone age was measured at 0 and 12 months.RESULTS: In all boys growth velocity continued appropriately for bone age. Puberty continued to progress in all boys and in two boys the amount of virilisation exceeded that seen with previous treatment with intramuscular testosterone. After testosterone administration, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone suppressed incompletely in the boys with primary hypogonadism. Serum testosterone ranged from 4.3 to 26.7 nmol/l at three months to less than 10 nmol/l at six months after implantation. Prolactin and lipid levels were normal throughout the study. By report, there was an improvement in mood and emotional wellbeing. No pellet extrusions occurred in a total of 156 pellet insertions.CONCLUSIONS: All boys preferred this mode of testosterone administration to intramuscular injections. Long acting subcutaneous testosterone pellets are safe, efficacious, well tolerated, and convenient, and result in normal physical growth and improved psychological outlook in adolescent hypogonadal boys.",

    "abstract": "All-trans retinoic acid administered orally (oral ATRA) may not regularly lead to either molecular complete remissions (CRs) or prolonged hematologic CRs (HCR) unless combined with chemotherapy. Because serum tretinoin concentrations are higher, and maintained longer, after use of liposomal-encapsulated ATRA (lipoATRA) rather than oral ATRA, we investigated lipoATRA monotherapy in newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Patients received lipoATRA 90 mg/m(2) every other day for remission induction. The same dose was given 3 times a week until 9 months had elapsed from HCR date. Treatment then stopped. Chemotherapy (idarubicin 12 mg/m(2) daily days 1-2 for 2 courses) was to be added only if 2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, performed 2 weeks apart, were positive at 3, 6, or 9 months from HCR date. The sensitivity level of the PCR was 10(-4). We treated 18 patients (median age, 54 years; median white blood cell [WBC] count 4,500/microL). The HCR rate was 12/18 (67%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 41% to 87%). This rate was similar to that we observed in a previous study using oral ATRA + idarubicin. Nine of 10 patients studied at HCR date were PCR-positive. Subsequently, however, overall (+/- idarubicin) rates of PCR positivity were 0/12 at 3 months, 1/10 at 6 months, 1/7 at 9 and 12 months, and 0/4 at 15 to 17 months. Idarubicin has been added in 3 patients, with this addition occurring at 6 months in 2 patients and at 9 months in 1 patient. Among patients who had not received idarubicin when the PCR was evaluated, 0 of 12 were PCR-positive at 3 months, 1 of 10 was positive at 6 months, 1 of 6 was positive at 9 months, 0 of 4 were positive at 12 months, and 0 of 3 were positive at 15 to 17 months. Morphologic APL has recurred in 1 patient, with a median follow-up time of 13 months in the 11 patients remaining in first CR. The median follow-up time is 91/2 months (range, 3 to 17) in the 9 patients who have received only lipoATRA and who remain PCR-negative and in first CR. Our data suggest that lipoATRA is an effective means of producing molecular CR in newly diagnosed APL.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Elase is a widely used ointment consisting of a combination of 2 proteolytic enzymes, fibrinolysin and desoxyribonuclease (DNAse). It is said to promote debridement of necrotic and purulent debris from skin ulcers.OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess the efficacy and safety of this ointment and its components in the treatment of chronic ulcers of the lower extremity.METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomized, prospective study of 84 patients with leg ulcers exhibiting necrotic and purulent debris, who were treated for 21 days with twice-daily applications of the ointment, fibrinolysin, DNAse, or who received the ointment vehicle (placebo). We assessed 6 efficacy features: ulcer size, purulent exudate, necrotic tissue, erythema, pain, and overall condition of the lesion at days 8, 15, and 21 after initiation of treatment. We also assessed the frequency of adverse effects.RESULTS: All treatments produced some improvement in the efficacy parameters and overall condition of the ulcers by week 3, but no statistically significant difference was found when compared with placebo. No serious adverse effects were noted. A later retrospective reanalysis of the data found a statistically significant reduction of purulent exudate only at days 3 and 7 of treatment in the group treated with the complete ointment, but not in the other features.CONCLUSION: The proteolytic ointment provides no long-term clinical benefit in reducing purulent exudate, pain, erythema, necrotic tissue, or overall condition of chronic leg ulcers when compared with either of its two components or placebo.",

No statistically significant or clinically relevant differences were found between the treatment groups for: daily or cumulative dose and duration of treatment with amphotericin B; incidence and time of dose modifications or infusion duration changes related to toxicity; dose or duration of symptomatic support with opiates, antipyretics, or antihistamines; renal function; subjective tolerance; most common toxicity scores; course of infection; and incidence of treatment failures. Patients treated with amphotericin B in intralipid were given fewer diuretics (P<0.05) and therefore had more peripheral oedema (P<0.01) and needed less potassium supplementation (P<0.05) than patients given amphotericin in glucose. Acute respiratory events were more common in the intralipid arm (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Amphotericin B 0.75 mg/kg/day in intralipid given on eight consecutive days then alternate days provides no benefit and is associated with potential pulmonary side effects possibly because of fat overload or an incompatibility of the two drugs.",

    "title": "Additional antianginal and anti-ischemic efficacy of mibefradil in patients concomitantly treated with long-acting nitrates for chronic stable angina pectoris.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mibefradil, a newly approved antihypertensive and antianginal drug, is the first member of a new class of calcium antagonists (CAs), the tetralol derivatives, that selectively blocks T-type Ca2+ channels in contrast to classical CAs which, at therapeutic concentrations, block only L-type Ca2+ channels. Since patients with chronic stable angina pectoris typically may be treated with the combination of a long-acting nitrate and a CA, the additive efficacy and safety of mibefradil in combination with nitrate therapy needs to be determined.HYPOTHESIS: This study was designed to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of mibefradil when added to long-acting nitrate therapy in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris.METHODS: Following a 1-week placebo run-in period, patients were randomized to receive either mibefradil 50 mg (n = 96) or placebo (n = 93) once daily in addition to their nitrate therapy. After 2 weeks of active treatment, patients receiving the mibefradil were force titrated to 150 mg once daily for an additional 2 weeks. Exercise tolerance tests (ETTs) were performed at the end of Weeks 2 and 4; patients also maintained an anginal diary during the 4-week treatment period.RESULTS: After 2 weeks of treatment with 50 mg mibefradil (within the current recommended dose range), a statistically significant but modest increase in total exercise duration was observed (treatment effect 16.4 s, p = 0.04). Similarly, there was a significant increase in time to onset of ischemia (treatment effect 26 s, p = 0.008). The adverse event profile of the 50 mg dose was indistinguishable from placebo, indicating that this dose was extremely well tolerated. At Week 4, the mibefradil-treated patients were taking 150 mg, which is above the current recommended dose range. The increase in total exercise duration was larger for the mibefradil 150 mg group than for the placebo group. For the intent-to-treat population, this difference did not reach statistical significance, whereas in the standard population it did (treatment effect 21 s, p = 0.05). The other two ETT variables, time to onset of angina and time to onset of 1 mm ST-segment depression, demonstrated significantly greater effect with mibefradil 150 mg (treatment effects 40 s, p = 0.002, and 55 s, p < 0.001, respectively, for the intent-to-treat population). Mibefradil 150 mg was associated with more adverse events than placebo, specifically, dizziness, leg edema, and postural hypotension.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that mibefradil 50 mg once daily in the setting of the background long-acting nitrate therapy produces additive antianginal and anti-ischemic effects and is extremely well tolerated.",

Work required per unit displacement was calculated. 2. Specificity: Pilot serial daytime measurements gave an overall mean ratio, work required on activation over baseline, of 2.94 (95% CI 2.53, 3.42) in two elderly untreated parkinsonians, and 3.19 (2.75, 3.71) in two elderly subjects with isolated, clinically activation phenomenon, compared with 1.90 (1.64, 2.21) in two elderly without (P < 0.001), whilst two young adults did not activate, 0.98 (0.85, 1.14). In elderly subjects, work required under activation decreased during the day in health (-10 (-5, -14)% h-1, P = 0.0002), showed no significant change in those with clinical activation (4 (-1, 9)% h-1), and increased in parkinsonians (6 (0, 12)% h-1, P = 0.05): there appeared to be a transitionary state. 3. Validation of methodology: Quantifying the same work ratio on a single occasion in 20 aged parkinsonians (P), their spouses (Ps), 20 index controls (C) without parkinsonism, matched to (P), and their spouses (Cs) gave corroborative evidence of a pre-clinical state, defined by other measurements, in the spouses of sufferers. Values for C, Cs and Ps, 1.89 (1.42, 2.52), 2.38 (1.79, 3.17) and 2.93 (2.20, 3.90) respectively, were in consecutive positions, from health to (P, 2.96 (2.22, 3.95)) disease (P = 0.001 for Ps c.f. C; P = 0.1 for Ps c.f. Cs). Data on change over the day may enhance discrimination. 4. Sensitivity to medicines was illustrated, in two parkinsonians, by randomised, placebo balanced and controlled challenges: 1 and 2 tablets, Sinemet CR (Du Pont Pharmaceuticals, each levodopa 200 mg/carbidopa 50 mg) and 1 tablet, Sinemet-Plus (levodopa 100 mg/carbidopa 25 mg), then two 2 mg tablets, benzhexol. The dopaminergic effect (P < 0.001) was selective for activation (treatment.test-condition interaction, P = 0.004), and showed the expected time profiles. The effect of benzhexol (P = 0.008) lacked such selectivity. Its onset (> 4, < or = 6 h) was delayed, compatible with a gastrointestinal anti-muscarinic action and the subjects' ages. 5. Reliability (Fleiss's criterion) was shown to be good in 30 untreated parkinsonians.",

    "abstract": "Invasive fungal infection is an increasing source of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies, particularly those with prolonged and severe neutropenia (absolute white blood cell count < 100/microL). Early diagnosis of invasive fungal infection is difficult, suggesting that antifungal prophylaxis could be the best approach for neutropenic patients undergoing intensive myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Consequently, antifungal prophylaxis has been extensively studied for more than 20 years. Nonabsorbable polyenes reduce superficial mycoses but are not effective in preventing or treating invasive fungal infections. Intravenous amphotericin B and the newer azoles were used in numerous clinical trials, but the value of antifungal prophylaxis in defined risk groups with cancer is still open to discussion. Recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplants and patients with a relapsed leukemia are high-risk patient populations. In addition, certain risk factors are well defined, for example, neutropenia more than 10 days, corticosteroid therapy, sustained immunosuppression, and graft-versus-host disease. In contrast to study efforts, evidence-based recommendations on the clinical use of antifungal prophylaxis according to risk groups are rare. The objective of this review of 50 studies accumulating more than 9000 patients is to assess evidence-based criteria with regard to the efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis in neutropenic cancer patients.",

Calcipotriene is an analog of calcitriol that has low calcemic activity and aids in clearing psoriasis.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the safety of topical therapy with calcipotriene particularly in relation to calcium and bone metabolism.METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, parallel, vehicle-controlled trial, 78 adults with plaque psoriasis were treated twice daily with topical calcipotriene ointment (50 microgram/gm, maximum usage, 120 gm per week) or vehicle for 8 weeks. After a screening visit, patients were admitted to the hospital at weeks 0 (baseline), 1,2,4, and 8. Blood and urine chemistry analysis included parathyroid hormone, serum calcium, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, urinary hydroxyproline, and 24 hour urinary calcium excretion. Bone densitometry measures were performed at baseline and week 8.RESULTS: No incidences of calcipotriene treatment-related hypercalcemia, calcium mobilization from bone, or clinically significant changes in bone density wer noted during this study.CONCLUSION: Topical application of up to 120 gm per week of calcipotriene ointment for 8 weeks is safe and effective for plaque psoriasis. There were no adverse effects on calcium and bone metabolism during this 8 week study.",

Group III volunteers (n = 18) were untreated and followed for bone density changes.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease extent at follow-up laparoscopy; pain, vasomotor, and vaginal symptom scores; bone mineral density (serial dual-energy roentgenogram absorptiometry scans); serum estrogens, lipids, and glucose and insulin response to glucose challenge.RESULTS: Painful symptoms and extent of endometriosis were reduced in both treatment groups. Despite maintenance of a chronically hypoestrogenic state for 48 weeks, no changes in bone density over time or in comparison to group III untreated controls were noted. Similarly, no evidence of significant vasomotor symptoms were reported in either treatment group. However, adverse changes over time in circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 levels as well as the ratio of high-density lipoprotein to LDL were noted only in group II.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of cyclic sodium etidronate and low-dose norethindrone with a long-acting GnRH-a served to safely prolong medical therapy of symptomatic endometriosis. Clinical efficacy was preserved while prophylaxis against significant hypoestrogenic side effects was achieved.",

    "abstract": "The efficacies of bupivacaine and lidocaine together with a preoperatively administered single-dose oral combination of normal- and sustained-release preparations of diclofenac in preventing postoperative pain after third molar removal were compared in a double-blind crossover study. Bilaterally impacted lower third molars were removed in two sessions. Each patient was given one type of local anesthetic on one session and the other in the second. Pain was recorded using a visual analog scale. When the diclofenac combination (150 mg) was given before the operation, postoperative analgesia was better with bupivacaine plus diclofenac than with lidocaine plus diclofenac. Twenty-five out of 40 patients preferred bupivacaine to lidocaine for local anesthesia. It is possible to achieve effective postoperative pain prevention by combining bupivacaine and preoperative normal- and sustained-release preparations of diclofenac.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine changes in trabecular vertebral bone mass, serum E2, and serum calcitonin during and after therapy of pelvic endometriosis with depot leuprolide acetate (LA) or danazol.DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind study.SETTING: Academic university hospital and department of obstetrics and gynecology.PATIENTS: Twelve women with symptomatic pelvic endometriosis diagnosed and staged by laparoscopy.INTERVENTIONS: All patients received blinded treatment with either 3.75 mg JM depot LA given every month and daily placebo tablets (n = 6) or 800 mg oral danazol daily with a monthly placebo injection (n = 6) for 24 weeks.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quantitated computerized tomography of bone density of thoracic 12 to lumbar 4 vertebral bodies were determined before, at the end of 24 weeks of treatment, and 6 and 12 months after completing treatment. Gain or loss of bone mass was based against pretreatment levels. Serial serum levels of E2 and calcitonin before, throughout, and after therapy were compared with changes in bone mass.RESULTS: Bone loss with LA was 14.0% +/- 0.5% (mean +/- SEM), recovering to a deficit of 4.2% +/- 3.8% and 3.3%, 6 and 12 months after stopping therapy. Danazol increased bone by 5.4% +/- 2.2%, with a further gain to 8.2% +/- 3.5% and 7.5%, 6 and 12 months after stopping treatment. Serum E2 levels usually were < 25 pg/mL (conversion factor to SI unit, 3.671) with LA but > 47.3 pg/mL with danazol. Calcitonin levels did not change significantly with either treatment.CONCLUSION: Depot LA produced marked sustained hypoestrogenemia and significant bone loss with incomplete recovery 1 year after stopping treatment. Danazol maintained normoestrogenemia and increased bone mass with the gain maintained even 1 year after stopping therapy.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A multicenter trial was conducted to determine the efficacy and toxicity of escalating dosages of liposomal tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid) administered once or three times weekly in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated Kaposi sarcoma.METHODS: Seventy-six patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated Kaposi sarcoma were randomized to receive the study drug either once (n = 30) or 3 times weekly (n = 46). The starting dosage was 60 mg/m(2), which was escalated to 90 mg/m(2) and then 120 mg/m(2) if the drug was well tolerated (<or= Grade 2 toxicities [according to the Southwest Oncology Group toxicity scale]). Four weeks of therapy constituted 1 cycle; patients could receive up to 8 cycles and those who completed 8 cycles were given the option of receiving extended therapy. Clinical response was defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD).RESULTS: Efficacy was assessed after the completion of 3 treatment cycles; 28.9% of patients (22 of 76 patients) responded (no CRs, 1 PR, and 21 SDs). Among the patients receiving treatment 3 times weekly, 16 of 49 patients (32.7%) achieved a clinical response at the end of the third treatment cycle (no CRs, 1 PR, and 15 SDs). Concomitant or prior use of protease inhibitors did not appear to affect the patient's response to treatment (P = 0.183).CONCLUSIONS: Liposomal tretinoin is a new therapeutic agent that has been reported to have some clinical activity in patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma. A three-times-per-week dosing schedule was noted to be more effective compared with a once-a-week schedule without any significant difference in toxicity reported.Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.DOI 10.1002/cncr.11009",

    "abstract": "DepoCyte is a slow-release formulation of cytarabine designed for intrathecal administration. The goal of this multi-centre cohort study was to determine the safety and efficacy of DepoCyte for the intrathecal treatment of neoplastic meningitis due to breast cancer. DepoCyte 50 mg was injected once every 2 weeks for one month of induction therapy; responding patients were treated with an additional 3 months of consolidation therapy. All patients had metastatic breast cancer and a positive CSF cytology or neurologic findings characteristic of neoplastic meningitis. The median number of DepoCyte doses was 3, and 85% of patients completed the planned 1 month induction. Median follow up is currently 19 months. The primary endpoint was response, defined as conversion of the CSF cytology from positive to negative at all sites known to be positive, and the absence of neurologic progression at the time the cytologic conversion was documented. The response rate among the 43 evaluable patients was 28% (CI 95%: 14-41%); the intent-to-treat response rate was 21% (CI 95%: 12-34%). Median time to neurologic progression was 49 days (range 1-515(+)); median survival was 88 days (range 1-515(+)), and 1 year survival is projected to be 19%. The major adverse events were headache and arachnoiditis. When drug-related, these were largely of low grade, transient and reversible. Headache occurred on 11% of cycles; 90% were grade 1 or 2. Arachnoiditis occurred on 19% of cycles; 88% were grade 1 or 2. DepoCyte demonstrated activity in neoplastic meningitis due to breast cancer that is comparable to results reported with conventional intrathecal agents. However, this activity was achieved with one fourth as many intrathecal injections as typically required in conventional therapy. The every 2 week dose schedule is a major advantage for both patients and physicians.Copyright 2001 Cancer Research Campaign.",

    "title": "Sildenafil citrate potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitric oxide donor drugs in male patients with stable angina.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We sought to study the effects of a single oral dose of sildenafil citrate (50 mg) on blood pressure (BP) in men taking the nitric oxide (NO) donor drugs isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) or glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) for stable angina.BACKGROUND: Sildenafil, a selective phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, is an orally effective treatment for erectile dysfunction. The presence of phosphodiesterases in the vasculature suggests the possibility of an interaction between sildenafil and NO donor drugs.METHODS: Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, two-way crossover trials were undertaken. Sixteen male patients received oral ISMN (20 mg twice a day) for five to seven days before their dose of sildenafil or placebo and continued receiving ISMN daily until administration of the alternate drug seven days later. For the second study, 15 male patients received sublingual GTN (500 microg) 1 h after sildenafil or placebo on each of two study days, which were seven days apart. Sitting or standing BP was measured before and for 6 h after the administration of the study drug.RESULTS: The effects of sildenafil plus ISMN on BP (standing mean maximum reductions from baseline in systolic/diastolic BP, -52/-29 mm Hg) were greater than the effects of placebo plus ISMN on BP (-25/-15 mm Hg; p < 0.001). Sildenafil plus GTN also resulted in greater sitting mean maximum reductions from baseline in systolic/diastolic BP (-36/-21 mm Hg) compared with placebo plus GTN (-26/-12 mm Hg; p < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Coadministration of sildenafil with ISMN or GTN produced significantly greater reductions in BP than ISMN or GTN alone. Based on these data, sildenafil should not be administered to patients taking nitrates.",

    "abstract": "The liposomal formulation of amphotericin B (AmBisome) greatly reduces the acute and chronic side effects of the parent drug. The present study describes the pharmacokinetic characteristics of AmBisome applied to 10 patients at a dose of 2.8 to 3.0 mg/kg of body weight and compares them to the pharmacokinetics observed in 6 patients treated with amphotericin B deoxycholate at the standard dose of 1.0 mg/kg. Interpatient variabilities of amphotericin B peak concentrations (Cmax) and areas under concentration-time curves (AUC) were 8- to 10-fold greater for patients treated with AmBisome than for patients treated with amphotericin B deoxycholate. At the threefold greater dose of AmBisome, median Cmaxs were 8.4-fold higher (14.4 versus 1.7 microg/ml) and median AUCs exceeded those observed with amphotericin B deoxycholate by 9-fold. This was in part explained by a 5.7-fold lower volume of distribution (0.42 liters/kg) in AmBisome-treated patients. The elimination of amphotericin B from serum was biphasic for both formulations. However, the apparent half-life of elimination was twofold shorter for AmBisome (P = 0.03). Neither hemodialysis nor hemofiltration had a significant impact on AmBisome pharmacokinetics as analyzed in one patient. In conclusion, the liposomal formulation of amphotericin B significantly (P = 0.001) reduces the volume of drug distribution, thereby allowing for greater drug concentrations in serum. The low toxicity of AmBisome therefore cannot readily be explained by its serum pharmacokinetics.",

The pregnancy rate was 51% in comparison with 32% in control cycles in which follicular maturation was achieved by human chorionic gonadotropin administration. There was no significant difference in the postoocyte recovery serum progesterone patterns between the two groups. Our results indicate that the induction of endogenous LH and FSH surge with GnRH-a may be successfully employed for final follicular maturation after ovarian suprastimulation without affecting the outcome of IVF adversely. Apart from being a more physiological approach to oocyte maturation, it also has potential economic and clinical advantages.",

    "title": "New molecular methods for classification, diagnosis and therapy prediction of hematological malignancies.",
    "abstract": "Normal functions of the cell are based on the precise regulation of various genes. If this strict regulation and the hierarchy of genes becomes upset due to flaws in this system, the result will be cellular dysfunction which eventually may lead to carcinogenic transformation. Two basic challenges of the classification of cancers are the discovery of new molecular markers characteristic to defined disease groups and the classification of already diagnosed or new cases into existing groups. This precise classification may open the door to tailored treatment or project the expected outcome of the disease. Today there is unlimited access available to the databases containing sequences and localization of the genes within the confines of Human Genome project. It provides significant help for the discovery of chromosome abnormalities and systematic analysis of gene expression patterns. This is important not only to understand normal functions of the cells, but it also contributes to the identification of new genes that are characteristic to given disease groups as markers and that are potential drug targets. Until the second half of the twentieth century the study of the function and regulation of genes was based on step-by-step investigation of individual genes. Regarding the fact, that the genomes of an increasing number of organisms have become known in whole or in part, numerous new techniques have been developed that facilitated the systematic analysis of gene functions. The aim of this study is to summarize the new, molecular based possibilities for classification, diagnosis and prognosis of hematological malignancies, as well as to summarize the main results of these areas.",

    "title": "The Venus flytrap of periplasmic binding proteins: an ancient protein module present in multiple drug receptors.",
    "abstract": "Located between the inner and outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) scavenge or sense diverse nutrients in the environment by coupling to transporters or chemotaxis receptors in the inner membrane. Their three-dimensional structures have been deduced in atomic detail with the use of X-ray crystallography, both in the free and liganded state. PBPs consist of two large lobes that close around the bound ligand, resembling a Venus flytrap. This architecture is reiterated in transcriptional regulators, such as the lac repressors. In the process of evolution, genes encoding the PBPs have fused with genes for integral membrane proteins. Thus, diverse mammalian receptors contain extracellular ligand binding domains that are homologous to the PBPs; these include glutamate/glycine-gated ion channels such as the NMDA receptor, G protein-coupled receptors, including metabotropic glutamate, GABA-B, calcium sensing, and pheromone receptors, and atrial natriuretic peptide-guanylate cyclase receptors. Many of these receptors are promising drug targets. On the basis of homology to PBPs and a recently resolved crystal structure of the extracellular binding domain of a glutamate receptor ion channel, it is possible to construct three-dimensional models of their ligand binding domains. Together with the extensive information available on the mechanism of ligand binding to PBPs, such models can serve as a guide in drug discovery.",

    "title": "Drug targets and mechanisms of resistance in the anaerobic protozoa.",
    "abstract": "The anaerobic protozoa Giardia duodenalis, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Entamoeba histolytica infect up to a billion people each year. G. duodenalis and E. histolytica are primarily pathogens of the intestinal tract, although E. histolytica can form abscesses and invade other organs, where it can be fatal if left untreated. T. vaginalis infection is a sexually transmitted infection causing vaginitis and acute inflammatory disease of the genital mucosa. T. vaginalis has also been reported in the urinary tract, fallopian tubes, and pelvis and can cause pneumonia, bronchitis, and oral lesions. Respiratory infections can be acquired perinatally. T. vaginalis infections have been associated with preterm delivery, low birth weight, and increased mortality as well as predisposing to human immunodeficiency virus infection, AIDS, and cervical cancer. All three organisms lack mitochondria and are susceptible to the nitroimidazole metronidazole because of similar low-redox-potential anaerobic metabolic pathways. Resistance to metronidazole and other drugs has been observed clinically and in the laboratory. Laboratory studies have identified the enzyme that activates metronidazole, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, to its nitroso form and distinct mechanisms of decreasing drug susceptibility that are induced in each organism. Although the nitroimidazoles have been the drug family of choice for treating the anaerobic protozoa, G. duodenalis is less susceptible to other antiparasitic drugs, such as furazolidone, albendazole, and quinacrine. Resistance has been demonstrated for each agent, and the mechanism of resistance has been investigated. Metronidazole resistance in T. vaginalis is well documented, and the principal mechanisms have been defined. Bypass metabolism, such as alternative oxidoreductases, have been discovered in both organisms. Aerobic versus anaerobic resistance in T. vaginalis is discussed. Mechanisms of metronidazole resistance in E. histolytica have recently been investigated using laboratory-induced resistant isolates. Instead of downregulation of the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase and ferredoxin pathway as seen in G. duodenalis and T. vaginalis, E. histolytica induces oxidative stress mechanisms, including superoxide dismutase and peroxiredoxin. The review examines the value of investigating both clinical and laboratory-induced syngeneic drug-resistant isolates and dissection of the complementary data obtained. Comparison of resistance mechanisms in anaerobic bacteria and the parasitic protozoa is discussed as well as the value of studies of the epidemiology of resistance.",

The use of objective measurements and clinical features to assess response to therapy were evaluated in relation to the decision to admit or discharge the patient or arrange for follow-up care.OUTCOMES: Control of symptoms and disease reflected in hospital admission rates, frequency of treatment failures following discharge, resolution of symptoms and improvement of spirometric test results.EVIDENCE: Previous guidelines, articles retrieved through a search of MEDLINE, emergency medical abstracts and information from members of the expert panel were reviewed by members of the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP) and the Canadian Thoracic Society. Where evidence was not available, consensus was reached by the expert panel. The resulting guidelines were reviewed by members of the parent organizations.VALUES: The evidence-based methods and values of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination were used.BENEFITS, HARMS AND COSTS: As many as 80% of the approximate 400 deaths from asthma each year in Canada are felt to be preventable. The use of guidelines, aggressive emergency management and consistent use of available options at discharge are expected to decrease the rates of unnecessary hospital admissions and return visits to emergency departments because of treatment failures. Substantial decreases in costs are expected from the use of less expensive drugs, or drug delivery systems, fewer hospital admissions and earlier return to full activity after discharge.RECOMMENDATIONS: Beta2-agonists are the first-line therapy for the management of acute asthma in the emergency department (grade A recommendation). Bronchodilators should be administered by the inhaled route and titrated using objective and clinical measures of airflow limitation (grade A). Metered-dose inhalers are preferred to wet nebulizers, and a chamber (spacer device) is recommended for severe asthma (grade A). Anticholinergic therapy should be added to beta 2 agonist therapy in severe and life-threatening cases and may be considered in cases of mild to moderate asthma (grade A). Aminophylline is not recommended for use in the first 4 hours of therapy (grade A). Ketamine and succinylcholine are recommended for rapid sequence intubation in life-threatening cases (grade B). Adrenaline (administered subcutaneously or intravenously), salbutamol (administered intravenously) and anesthetics (inhaled) are recommended as alternatives to conventional therapy in unresponsive life-threatening cases (grade B). Severity of airflow limitation should be determined according to the forced expiratory volume at 1 second or the peak expiratory flow rate, or both, before and after treatment and at discharge (grade A). Consideration for discharge should be based on both spirometric test results and assessment of clinical risk factors for relapse (grade A). All patients should be considered candidates for systemic corticosteroid therapy at discharge (grade A). Those requiring corticosteroid therapy should be given 30 to 60 mg of prednisone orally (or equivalent) per day for 7 to 14 days; no tapering is required (grade A). Inhaled corticosteroids are an integral component of therapy and should be prescribed for all patients receiving oral corticosteroid therapy at discharge (grade A). Patients should be given a discharge treatment plan and clear instructions for follow-up care (grade C).VALIDATION: The guidelines share the same principles of those from the British Thoracic Society and the National Institutes of Health. Two specific validation initiatives have been undertaken: (a) several Canadian centres have been involved in the collection of comprehensive administrative data to assess compliance and outcome measures and (b) a survey of Canadian emergency physicians conducted to gather baseline informaton of treatment patterns, was conducted before development of the guidelines and will be repeated to re-evaluate emergency management of asthma.",

    "title": "Sodium ion cycle in bacterial pathogens: evidence from cross-genome comparisons.",
    "abstract": "Analysis of the bacterial genome sequences shows that many human and animal pathogens encode primary membrane Na+ pumps, Na+-transporting dicarboxylate decarboxylases or Na+ translocating NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, and a number of Na+ -dependent permeases. This indicates that these bacteria can utilize Na+ as a coupling ion instead of or in addition to the H+ cycle. This capability to use a Na+ cycle might be an important virulence factor for such pathogens as Vibrio cholerae, Neisseria meningitidis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, and Yersinia pestis. In Treponema pallidum, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, the Na+ gradient may well be the only energy source for secondary transport. A survey of preliminary genome sequences of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Treponema denticola indicates that these oral pathogens also rely on the Na+ cycle for at least part of their energy metabolism. The possible roles of the Na+ cycling in the energy metabolism and pathogenicity of these organisms are reviewed. The recent discovery of an effective natural antibiotic, korormicin, targeted against the Na+ -translocating NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, suggests a potential use of Na+ pumps as drug targets and/or vaccine candidates. The antimicrobial potential of other inhibitors of the Na+ cycle, such as monensin, Li+ and Ag+ ions, and amiloride derivatives, is discussed.",

    "title": "Pharmacogenetics: an opportunity for a safer and more efficient pharmacotherapy.",
    "abstract": "Drug treatment is in many cases ineffective. Besides patients who do not respond to the treatment despite receiving expensive drugs, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as a consequence of the treatment, is estimated to cost the US society 100 billion USD and over 100,000 deaths per year. Pharmacogenetics is the discipline which takes the patient's genetic information of drug transporters, drug metabolizing enzymes and drug receptors into account to allow for an individualized drug therapy leading to optimal choice and dose of the drugs in question. It is believed that much cost for the society can be saved in this manner. Many drug transporters are polymorphic. In addition, the majority of phase I and phase II dependent drug metabolism is carried out by polymorphic enzymes which can cause abolished, quantitatively or qualitatively altered or enhanced drug metabolism. Stable duplication, multiduplication or amplification of active genes, most likely in response to dietary components that have resulted in a selection of alleles with multiple noninducible genes, has been described. Several examples exist where subjects carrying certain alleles suffer from a lack of drug efficacy because of ultrarapid metabolism caused by multiple genes or by induction of gene expression, or, alternatively, adverse effects from the drug treatment as a result of the presence of defective alleles. The information about the role of polymorphic drug receptors for efficiency of drug therapy is more scarce, although promising examples are seen in drug treatment of asthma where the efficiency can be severely enhanced by predictive genotyping of the drug targets. In addition, certain polymorphic genes can be used as markers for optimization of the drug therapy. It is likely that predictive genotyping is of benefit in 10-20% of drug treatment and thereby allows for prevention of causalities as a cause of ADRs and thus improves the health for a significant fraction of the patients. In 15-40% of the cases, the penetrance of genetic polymorphism is of less importance because of the polygenic influence on the outcome of drug treatment and in 50% of the cases, pharmacogenetics would be without influence because of other more important physiological and environmental factors. In the present contribution an overview about our present knowledge how polymorphic genes can influence the drug efficacy is presented. Some emphasis will be given to different forms of cytochrome P450 which are of importance for drug metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The deposition of beta-amyloid (A beta) in neuronal plaques is believed to be crucial for the initiation and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies in vitro have shown that inhibiting cholesterol metabolism with lovastatin, or its active metabolite lovastatin acid, lowers A beta production. To examine the effects of lovastatin on A beta in vivo, human subjects who had elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were treated during a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with 10, 20, 40 or 60 mg once-daily doses of a controlled-release formulation of lovastatin, or matching placebo. Serum A beta concentrations were measured before and after up to 3 months of treatment. Mean and median changes from baseline in serum A beta concentrations showed a dose-dependent decrease, and analysis of variance indicated that treatment was statistically significant (p < 0.0348). Differences between the 40- and 60-mg dose groups and placebo were statistically significant (Dunnett's p < or = 0.05).",

N Engl J Med. 1998 Aug 6;339(6):401-2. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199808063390610.BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is often treated with glucocorticoids or mesalamine. We compared the efficacy and safety of controlled-ileal-release budesonide capsules and slow-release mesalamine tablets in patients with active Crohn's disease affecting the ileum, the ascending colon, or both.METHODS: In a double-blind, multicenter trial, we enrolled 182 patients with scores of 200 to 400 on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (with higher scores indicating greater disease activity) and randomly assigned 93 to receive 9 mg of budesonide once daily and 89 to receive 2 g of mesalamine twice daily for 16 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was clinical remission, defined as a score of 150 or less on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index.RESULTS: In the analysis of all patients who received at least one dose of study drug, the rates of remission after 8 weeks of treatment were 69 percent in the budesonide group and 45 percent in the mesalamine group (P=0.001); the respective rates after 16 weeks of treatment were 62 percent and 36 percent (P<0.001). Seventy-seven patients in the budesonide group completed the 16 weeks of treatment, as compared with 50 patients in the mesalamine group (P<0.001). The numbers of patients with adverse events were similar in the two groups, but those assigned to budesonide had fewer severe adverse events. Among patients who completed 16 weeks of treatment, the morning plasma cortisol value was normal in 67 percent of budesonide-treated patients and 83 percent of mesalamine-treated patients (P=0.06); 90 percent and 100 percent, respectively, had normal increases in cortisol in response to cosyntropin (P=0.02).CONCLUSIONS: In patients with active Crohn's disease affecting the ileum, the ascending colon, or both, a controlled-ileal-release formulation of budesonide was more effective in inducing remission than a slow-release formulation of mesalamine.",

    "abstract": "One hundred and sixty-eight individuals (psoriatic patients treated with calcipotriol with dermatitis due to calcipotriol, psoriatic patients treated with calcipotriol with no dermatitis, psoriatic patients never treated with calcipotriol, patients with eczema and healthy volunteers) were patch-tested (Finn chambers, back, 48 h) with dilutions of calcipotriol ointment (50, 10, 2, 0.4 micrograms/g) and an ointment vehicle. Test evaluation was based on clinical scoring and various non-invasive measuring methods. Doubtful (?+) and weak (1+) reactions were common, irrespective of patient group and history. Moderate (2+) reactions were uncommon and with no increased frequency among psoriatic patients with adverse dermatitis during calcipotriol treatment. The blood flow of test sites measured by laser Doppler flowmetry was, however, increased in psoriatics, who developed dermatitis during calcipotriol treatment as an isolated finding. Furthermore a 1-week repeated open application test (ROAT) was performed on all subjects. None of the persons having a strong reaction in the patch test showed any dermatitis in the ROAT test, indicating that they were not sensitized. Calcipotriol was found to be a mild irritant of the non-corrosive type, i.e. with no influence on the skin barrier. Reactions were dominated by redness (increased laser Doppler flow and chroma a*) and only oedema formation in advanced reactions. The calcipotriol dose-irritation curve was found to be scattered. Calcipotriol induced no increase of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) versus the ointment vehicle, but the ointment vehicle itself increased TEWL. The special ointment vehicle needed for calcipotriol for stability reasons may itself be irritant and cause some impairment of the skin water barrier, with increase in TEWL values. Future patch test studies for calcipotriol allergy should not be done with this vehicle. The non-irritant threshold concentration of calcipotriol in an appropriate test vehicle is still unknown.",

    "title": "Overnight protection by inhaled salmeterol on exercise-induced asthma in children.",
    "abstract": "The main aim of the present study was to evaluate whether inhaled salmeterol given in the evening protected against exercise-induced asthma the next morning. Twenty three children (12 males and 11 females) with a mean age of 11 yrs and with exercise-induced asthma participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. The children inhaled salmeterol 25 micrograms, salmeterol 50 micrograms and placebo by Diskhaler at 10 p.m. on 3 separate days. Next morning, half of the children ran on a motor-driven treadmill for 6 min at submaximal load at 8 a.m. and the remainder at 10 a.m. Lung function was measured by maximal expiratory flow-volume loops before running, immediately after, and 3, 6, 10 and 15 min after running. The mean maximum reduction in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) after treadmill run was 34% before inclusion in the study. Mean maximum fall in FEV1 was significantly greater after placebo: 30% (23-36) 95% confidence interval) than after salmeterol 25 micrograms: 19% (12-23) or salmeterol 50 micrograms: 18% (12-25). In addition to the reduced postexercise bronchoconstriction, pre-exercise lung function (FEV1) was significantly higher both after salmeterol 25 micrograms: 2.4 L.s-1 (2.1-2.7) and salmeterol 50 micrograms: 2.5 L.s-1 (2.2-2.8) than after placebo: 2.2 L.s-1 (1.9-2.5). No significant differences in pre- and postexercise lung function were found between children tested at 8 or 10 a.m., or in relation to salmeterol dosage. Thus, inhaled salmeterol 25 and 50 micrograms offered similar overnight protection against exercise-induced asthma and improved baseline lung function in the morning as compared to placebo.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Platelet aggregation and secondary vasoconstriction are key events in the genesis of acute coronary syndromes.HYPOTHESIS: Since nitrates have vasodilatory and antiaggregant effects, treatment with long-acting nitrates at the time of onset of acute coronary syndromes could be associated with attenuation of their severity.METHODS: A consecutive series of 533 patients with acute coronary syndrome and past history of coronary artery disease admitted to the Cardiology Service of a general hospital was studied. A specific questionnaire assessed the use of nitrates and other relevant drugs, as well as other clinical variables. The diagnosis of unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction (MI) was established according to clinical, electrocardiographic, and enzymatic criteria.RESULTS: In the whole cohort, 169 patients had MI and 364 had unstable angina. Previous use of long-acting nitrates was significantly more common in patients with unstable angina (56%) than in those with MI (37%) (p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified being a nonsmoker [odds ratio: 95%, confidence limits (CL) 0.37, 0.23-0.59], previous unstable angina (CL 0.62, 0.41-0.92), use of aspirin (CL 0.58, 0.41-0.92), and use of long-acting nitrates (CL 0.61, 0.40-0.93) as the independent predictors of the development of unstable angina rather than MI; of these the combination of nitrates and aspirin was the strongest predictor.CONCLUSIONS: Long-acting nitrates as well as aspirin are suggested to have a protective or modifying effect on the development of acute coronary syndromes, favoring unstable angina rather than acute MI.",

Life-threatening infections especially with aspergillus are common despite optimal antimicrobial therapy. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is contraindicated during invasive aspergillosis in any disease setting. We report an 8-year-old patient with CGD who underwent HLA-genoidentical BMT during invasive multifocal aspergillus nidulans infection, nonresponsive to treatment with amphotericin-B and gamma-interferon. During the first 10 days post-BMT, the patient received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized, 25 Gy irradiated granulocytes from healthy volunteers plus G-CSF beginning on day 3 to prolong the viability of the transfused granulocytes. This was confirmed in vitro by apoptosis assays and in vivo by finding nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-positive granulocytes in peripheral blood 12 and 36 hours after the transfusions. Clinical and biological signs of infection began to disappear on day 7 post-BMT. Positron emission tomography with F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) and computed tomography (CT) scans at 3 months post-BMT showed complete disappearance of infectious foci. At 2 years post-BMT, the patient is well with full immune reconstitution and no sign of aspergillus infection. Our results show that HLA-identical BMT may be successful during invasive, noncontrollable aspergillus infection, provided that supportive therapy is optimal.Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.",

Concern has been raised that the d-enantiomer of fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, may also cause this problem. We were able to study the question by modifying an ongoing trial comparing dexfenfluramine with regular dexfenfluramine and placebo.METHODS: We modified our randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of dexfenfluramine to include echocardiographic examinations of 1072 overweight patients within a median of one month after the discontinuation of treatment. The patients (approximately 80 percent of whom were women) had been randomly assigned to receive dexfenfluramine (366 patients), investigational sustained-release dexfenfluramine (352 patients), or placebo (354 patients). The average duration of treatment was 71 to 72 days in each of the three groups. Echocardiograms were assessed in a blinded fashion.RESULTS: When all degrees of valvular regurgitation were considered and when the two dexfenfluramine groups were combined, there was a higher prevalence of any degree of aortic regurgitation (17.0 percent vs. 11.8 percent, P=0.03) and any degree of mitral regurgitation (61.4 percent vs. 54.4 percent, P=0.01) in the active-treatment groups than in the placebo group. These differences were primarily due to a higher prevalence of physiologic, trace, or mild regurgitation. Analyses that used the criteria of the Food and Drug Administration for aortic regurgitation of mild or greater severity and mitral regurgitation of moderate or greater severity found no statistically significant difference among the groups (P=0.14 to 0.75). These analyses showed that aortic regurgitation of mild or greater severity occurred in 5.0 percent of the patients in the dexfenfluramine group, 5.8 percent of those in the sustained-release dexfenfluramine group, 5.4 percent of those in the two active-treatment groups combined, and 3.6 percent of those in the placebo group. Mitral regurgitation of moderate or greater severity occurred in 1.7, 1.8, 1.8, and 1.2 percent, respectively. Aortic regurgitation of mild or greater severity, mitral regurgitation of moderate or greater severity, or both occurred in 6.5 percent, 7.3 percent, 6.9 percent, and 4.5 percent, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The increased prevalence of aortic and mitral regurgitation in patients treated with dexfenfluramine was small, and the degree of regurgitation was usually classified as physiologic, trace, or mild. However, the duration of therapy was short, and whether therapy of longer duration would yield the same or different results is not known.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies evaluating spirometric values and symptoms have shown that once daily theophylline administered in the evening produces greater stabilisation of the airway function in asthmatic patients than the prototype theophylline given twice a day. The aim of this study was to compare the effects on bronchial responsiveness to methacholine of an ultrasustained release theophylline formulation (Diffumal-24, Malesci, Florence, Italy) administered once a day, a sustained release theophylline formulation (Theo-Dur, Recordati, Milan, Italy) administered twice a day, and placebo.METHODS: The study was performed in 12 adult patients with asthma using a randomised, double blind, three phase, cross-over design. Each phase lasted seven days and was followed or preceded by at least three days of theophylline washout. Diffumal-24 was administered once a day at 20.00 hours whereas Theo-Dur was given twice a day at 08.00 hours and 20.00 hours. In each patient the total daily dose of theophylline was the same during both phases. The dose of the two active preparations was titrated to individual needs before the beginning of the study and then given in divided or once daily doses. At 08.00, 14.00, and 20.00 hours on day 7 of each phase serum theophylline concentrations were measured and spirometric tests (FEV1) and bronchial challenge with methacholine were also performed.RESULTS: When the administration of Diffumal-24 was compared with that of Theo-Dur, a higher serum theophylline concentration of the former was seen in the morning whereas at 20.00 hours the reverse was true. Compared with placebo, at 08.00 hours Diffumal-24 improved FEV1 whereas Theo-Dur did not (difference between treatments 0.29 1, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.45). At 08.00 hours Diffumal-24 decreased bronchial sensitivity to methacholine, expressed as a natural logarithm of PD20, to a greater extent than Theo-Dur (difference between treatments 0.54 log units, 95% CI 0.016 to 1.08). The morning advantage observed with Diffumal-24 administration was not associated with a deterioration in the state of the airway during the daytime, the protective activity against methacholine during the 12 hours of the monitoring period being constant.

    "title": "Oral budesonide is as effective as oral prednisolone in active Crohn's disease. The Global Budesonide Study Group.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of corticosteroids in active Crohn's disease often becomes limited by side effects. Budesonide is a potent corticosteroid with low systemic bioavailability due to an extensive first pass liver metabolism.AIMS: To compare the efficacy and safety of two dosage regimens of budesonide and prednisolone in patients with active Crohn's disease affecting the ileum and/or the ascending colon.PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and seventy eight patients were randomised to receive budesonide controlled ileal release (CIR) capsules 9 mg once daily or 4.5 mg twice daily, or prednisolone tablets 40 mg once daily. The treatment period was 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was clinical remission, defined as a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of 150 or less.RESULTS: After eight weeks of treatment, remission occurred in 60% of patients receiving budesonide once daily or prednisolone and in 42% of those receiving budesonide twice daily (p = 0.062). The presence of glucocorticoid associated side effects was similar in all groups; however, moon face was more common in the prednisolone group (p = 0.0005). The highest frequency of impaired adrenal function, as measured by a short ACTH test, was found in the prednisolone group (p = 0.0023).CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide CIR, administered at 9 mg once daily or 4.5 mg twice daily, is comparable to prednisolone in inducing remission in active Crohn's disease. The single dose administration is as promptly effective as prednisolone and represents a simpler and safer therapeutic approach, with a considerable reduction in side effects.",

    "title": "pain. Recently, controlled-release (CR) oxycodone tablets were developed to provide the benefits of twice-a-day dosing to patients treated with oxycodone. The purpose of this investigation was to develop and validate a pharmacokinetic model for CR oxycodone tablets in comparison with IR oxycodone solution. 2. Twenty-four normal male volunteers were enrolled in a single-dose, randomized, analytically blinded, two-way crossover study designed to compare the pharmacokinetics of two 10 mg CR oxycodone tablets with 20 mg IR oxycodone oral solution. Pharmacokinetic models describing the oxycodone plasma concentration vs time profiles of CR tablets and IR solution were derived using NONMEM version IV. The predictive performance of the models was assessed by comparison of predicted oxycodone plasma concentrations with actual oxycodone plasma concentrations observed in a separate group of 21 volunteers who received repeated doses of IR and CR oxycodone for 4 days. 3. The unit impulse disposition function of oxycodone was best described by a one-compartment model. Absorption rate of the IR solution was best described by a mono-exponential model with a lag time, whereas absorption rate of the CR tablet was best described using a bi-exponential model. The absorption profile of the CR tablets was characterized by a rapid absorption component (t1/2abs = 37 min) accounting for 38% of the available dose and a slow absorption phase (t1/2abs = 6.2 h) accounting for 62% of the available dose. Two 10 mg tablets of oral CR oxycodone hydrochloride were 102.7% bioavailable relative to 20 mg of IR oxycodone hydrochloride oral solution. The population model derived after administration of a single dose accurately predicted both the mean and range of oxycodone concentrations observed during 4 days of repeated dosing. The mean prediction error was 2.7% with a coefficient of variation of 54%. 4. The absorption characteristics of CR oxycodone tablets should allow effective plasma concentrations of oxycodone to be reached quickly and for effective concentrations to be maintained for a longer period after dosing compared with the IR oral solution. The CR dosage form has pharmacokinetic characteristics that permit 12 hourly dosing.",

Study 2--To assess therapeutic contribution of adrenaline and safety and efficacy of the formulations.DESIGN: Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled studies.SETTING: Private practices and university clinics in the United States.PATIENTS: Men and women with new, recurrent, or refractory external condylomata acuminata.INTERVENTION: Six injections over 8 weeks; follow up visits at weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12.EFFICACY: patient/wart response, times to complete response, recurrence rates.SAFETY: injection reactions, tissue conditions, other adverse events, laboratory studies.RESULTS: Study 1: 132 evaluable patients. Complete response (CR) rate was highest for the 5-FU/adrenaline gel group, followed by the 5-FU/adrenaline solution group, then the 5-FU gel group. 5-FU, adrenaline, and the collagen gel vehicle (in the presence of 5-FU) significantly affected CR and strongly influenced time to CR. The effects of 5-FU and adrenaline were statistically significant. Cutaneous reactions were mild to moderate. Study 2: 187 evaluable patients. Patients treated with 5-FU/adrenaline gel had a significantly higher CR rate and lower cumulative 90 day recurrence rate than those treated with 5-FU gel without adrenaline.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this new long-acting formulation in a large population of acromegalic patients previously responsive to lanreotide 30 mg, im (sustained release microparticle formulation). Lanreotide Autogel was administered by deep sc injection every 28 d to 107 patients (54 males and 53 females; mean age, 54 +/- 1.2 yr). All patients had been treated with lanreotide (30 mg) for at least 3 months before study entry and had a mean GH level less than 10 ng/ml after at least 4 subsequent im injections every 14 d (48%), 10 d (32%), or 7 d (20%). Treatment was switched from lanreotide 30 mg injected every 14, 10, or 7 d to 60, 90, or 120 mg lanreotide Autogel, respectively, every 28 d. After three fixed dose injections of lanreotide Autogel, mean lanreotide levels were similar to those obtained at steady state with lanreotide 30 mg. During lanreotide Autogel treatment, the control of acromegalic symptoms was comparable with that previously achieved during lanreotide 30 mg treatment. After 3 injections of lanreotide Autogel, mean GH (2.87 +/- 0.22 ng/ml) and IGF-I (317 +/- 15 ng/ml) values were comparable with those recorded at the end of lanreotide 30 mg treatment (GH, 2.82 +/- 0.19 ng/ml; IGF-I, 323 +/- 16 ng/ml). GH levels below 2.5 ng/ml and age-/sex-normalized IGF-I were achieved in 33% and 39% of patients during lanreotide 30 mg and lanreotide Autogel treatment, respectively. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea were reported by 38%, 22%, and 18% of patients during lanreotide 30 mg treatment and by 29%, 17%, and 9% of patients, respectively, during lanreotide Autogel treatment. In conclusion, this clinical study shows that lanreotide Autogel is at least as efficacious and well tolerated as lanreotide 30 mg. This new long-acting lanreotide formulation, lanreotide Autogel, which is administered from a small volume, prefilled syringe by deep sc injection, is therefore likely to improve the acceptability of medical treatment for patients requiring long-term somatostatin analog therapy.",

Adverse events and safety were also evaluated.RESULTS: The mean BP fall was significantly greater with the combination (20/15 mmHg), p < 0.00054, as compared to both trandolapril (14/11 mmHg) or verapamil (13/11) mmHg. The difference between verapamil and trandolapril was not significant. Rate pressure product decreased significantly more on the combination, p < 0.001, than on trandolapril or verapamil alone. Treatment response to trandolapril was positively correlated to initial AR (r = 0.30-0.43). All treatments were well tolerated and safe.CONCLUSIONS: The new fixed drug combination trandolapril/verapamil was superior to monotherapy with either of these drugs alone regarding reduction of both BP and rate pressure product. This combination can be safely and effectively used for the treatment of mild to moderate primary hypertension.",

    "abstract": "We wanted to investigate whether time to steady state was reached within 2 h of insulin infusion during isoglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, comparing the glucose uptake index (M/IG) with Bergman's insulin sensitivity index (Sip). We performed a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test and a 3-h isoglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp in 26 young, healthy subjects and 43 elderly patients with unmedicated essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. The 3-h Sip correlated strongly with the 2-h M/IG in the patients (r = 0.88, p < 0.001) as well as in the healthy subjects (r = 0.96, p < 0.001) with relatively narrow limits of agreement in the patients. However, during the third hour of insulin infusion, M/IG (10.0 vs 12.21(2) x kg(-1) x min(-1) x mmol(-1), p < 0.001) as well as Sip (7.1 vs 9.41(2) x kg(-1) x min(-1) x mmol(-1), p < 0.001) increased significantly in the patients, but not in the healthy subjects. Because the 2-h M/IG correlated strongly with the 3-h Sip with relatively narrow limits of agreement, it is a good measure of insulin sensitivity. However, a 2-h clamp results in lower insulin sensitivity values in elderly, hypertensive patients due to the fact that steady state is not reached, demonstrating a higher prevalence of insulin resistance in such a population.",

The prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy decreased from 63% to 25%. Left ventricular fractional shortening increased from 34 +/- 2% to 41 +/- 3% (p less than 0.05) and the relation between fractional shortening and end-systolic stress did not change.

    "title": "relatively low levels of systemic absorption. 2. Pharmacokinetic evaluation of drug absorption from the lungs provides an accurate and reproducible method for comparing different inhaler delivery systems, as well as for evaluating bioequivalence of generic drug formulations. 3. The measurement of drug absorption from the lungs may also be applied to assess the effects of inhalation technique on drug delivery in vivo. For example with salbutamol delivered via a large volume spacer, lung bioavailability has been shown to be altered by factors such as the number of actuated puffs, inhalation-actuation delay and washing procedure. 4. Differences in drug delivery to the lungs between dry powder reservoir and pressurised metered-dose aerosol devices translate directly into commensurate differences in clinical efficacy for delivery of both inhaled beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists and corticosteroids. 5. For inhaled corticosteroids, pharmacokinetic evaluation using oral charcoal to obviate alimentary absorption may be applied to quantify the relative gut and lung components of systemic bioavailability. In tandem with information on receptor potency and affinity, drug elimination and distribution, these data may help in part to explain observed differences between different inhaled corticosteroids in terms of their systemic bioactivity profiles. 6. Studies are required to evaluate whether pharmacokinetic evaluation of lung absorption is a suitable way of quantifying delivery of nebulised aminoglycoside antibiotics, as for example in patients with cystic fibrosis. 7. Pharmacokinetic evaluation appears to have an established role in the quantification of drug delivery to the lungs and provides important information which is complimentary to other techniques such as radiolabelled deposition. The next decade of research into pharmacokinetics of established and novel drugs and delivery systems is awaited with keen interest, and will hopefully provide a greater understanding into ways of optimising the benefit-risk ratio for inhaled drugs.",

This study investigated the effect of age on inhaled dose from a conventional jet nebulizer (Acorn) used both with and without a storage chamber (Mizer), compared to two Venturi nebulizers (Ventstream and Pari LC). Filters were attached to the four nebulizer systems, containing salbutamol, and 18 children with cystic fibrosis (3-16 yrs) inhaled through these devices. The quantity of drug collected on the filter was assessed using ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The particle size distribution of the aerosol from each nebulizer system was measured using laser diffraction. Inspiratory filter deposition using the Acorn was lower than the Acorn with Mizer, and both Venturi nebulizers. Filter deposition using the Acorn with Mizer was lower than the Pari LC. No trend with age, height or weight was noted using any nebulizer. Aerosol particle size using the Ventstream was lower than the other nebulizer systems. Drug output from both Venturi nebulizers was more efficient than from the jet nebulizer, used with and without the storage chamber, during inhalation by children with cystic fibrosis. The inhaled dose did not change with the patient's age or size using both types of nebulizer.",

But several problems prohibited its spreading: (1) the accuracy and the reproducibility of the inhaled dose (range ca. 1:4); (2) the small amount of inhaled drug in relation to the dose in the aerosol delivery system (range ca. 1%-10%); (3) the fear of allergic reactions of the respiratory system; (4) the variability of the drug transport into the systemic circulation.

    "title": "Lipid-based systems for the intracellular delivery of genetic drugs.",
    "abstract": "Currently available delivery systems for genetic drugs have limited utility for systemic applications. Cationic liposome/plasmid DNA or oligonucleotide complexes are rapidly cleared from circulation, and the highest levels of activity are observed in 'first pass' organs, such as the lungs, spleen and liver. Engineered viruses can generate an immune response, which compromises transfection resulting from subsequent injections and lack target specificity. A carrier, which can accumulate at sites of diseases such as infections, inflammations and tumours, has to be a small, neutral and highly serum-stable particle, which is not readily recognized by the fixed and free macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system (RES). This review summarizes lipid-based technologies for the delivery of nucleic acid-based drugs and introduces a new class of carrier systems, which solve, at least in part, the conflicting demands of circulation longevity and intracellular delivery. Plasmid DNA and oligonucleotides are entrapped into lipid particles that contain small amounts of a positively charged lipid and are stabilized by the presence of a polythylene glycol (PEG) coating. These carriers protect nucleic acid-based drugs from degradation by nucleases, are on average 70 nm in diameter, achieve long circulation lifetimes and are capable of transfecting cells.",

    "title": "Structural, signalling and regulatory properties of the group I metabotropic glutamate receptors: prototypic family C G-protein-coupled receptors.",
    "abstract": "In 1991 a new type of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) was cloned, the type 1a metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor, which, despite possessing the defining seven-transmembrane topology of the GPCR superfamily, bore little resemblance to the growing number of other cloned GPCRs. Subsequent studies have shown that there are eight mammalian mGlu receptors that, together with the calcium-sensing receptor, the GABA(B) receptor (where GABA is gamma-aminobutyric acid) and a subset of pheromone, olfactory and taste receptors, make up GPCR family C. Currently available data suggest that family C GPCRs share a number of structural, biochemical and regulatory characteristics, which differ markedly from those of the other GPCR families, most notably the rhodopsin/family A GPCRs that have been most widely studied to date. This review will focus on the group I mGlu receptors (mGlu1 and mGlu5). This subgroup of receptors is widely and differentially expressed in neuronal and glial cells within the brain, and receptor activation has been implicated in the control of an array of key signalling events, including roles in the adaptative changes needed for long-term depression or potentiation of neuronal synaptic connectivity. In addition to playing critical physiological roles within the brain, the mGlu receptors are also currently the focus of considerable attention because of their potential as drug targets for the treatment of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted in order to evaluate the hormonal kinetics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of TAP-144-SR (3M) a three-month sustained-release injectable preparation of leuprorelin acetate, a highly active luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) derivative by comparing the treatment with two subcutaneous doses of the test medication TAP-144-SR (3M) and the treatment with six subcutaneous doses of the reference medication TAP-144-SR (1M), a 1-month sustained-release injectable preparation. Study participants were 103 patients with prostate cancer in whom a stable anti-tumor effect had been obtained with Leuplin Injection 3.75. The hormonal kinetics revealed that the proportion of the patients \"maintaining the castration level of serum testosterone (maximum serum testosterone level during treatment below the castration level [100 ng/dl])\" was 100% in both treatment groups. With regard to the efficacy, the proportions of the patients in whom the anti-tumor effects (> or = Stable) of the baseline treatment prior to the initiation of the treatment with the study medication were maintained during the study treatment period (6 months) were comparable; 84.0% with TAP-144-SR (1M) and 80.4% with TAP-144-SR (3M). On evaluation of the pharmacokinetics, the mean value of AUC1-12w of the serum TAP-144 concentration (including the metabolite M-I) for the treatment with TAP-144-SR (3M) was 77.0% that of the treatment with TAP-144-SR (1M). Adverse events were similar in the subjects on TAP-144-SR (3M) and in those on TAP-144-SR (1M). There existed no big differences in kind, incidence or time of occurrence of adverse events between two groups. TAP-144-SR (3M) showed no clinically relevant findings in particular. These results indicate that one dose of TAP-144-SR (3M) is comparable to three doses of the already approved Leuplin injection 3.75 in serum testosterone level-inhibitory effect, efficacy and safety. Hence, it is considered that TAP-144-SR (3M) is a drug suitable for treatment of prostate cancer over a prolonged period of time.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible therapeutic effects of interferon alpha-2b left in the peritoneum after surgery, followed by or not followed by treatment with GnRH analogs.DESIGN: A prospective, randomized clinical trial.SETTING: University hospital.PATIENT(S): Fifty-two infertile patients with moderate or severe endometriosis.INTERVENTION(S): Laparotomic conservative surgery and either interferon alpha-2b or saline alone left in the pouch of Douglas followed by administration of either GnRH analogs depot or oral indomethacin with transvaginal echography and analysis of CA-125, immunoglobulins, and lymphocyte populations.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Recurrence of endometriosis was considered clinically, echographically, and laparoscopically.RESULT(S): Recurrence of endometriosis in four cases without interferon (15.4%) versus 11 patients (42.3%) with interferon alpha-2b. Life table analysis showed significant differences between the groups with and without interferon 21 months after conservative surgery. There were no differences in the recurrence between the groups with or without GnRH analogs. Likewise, there were no significant changes in immunoglobulins and lymphocyte populations among patients with and without recurrence of endometriosis. The patients that received GnRH analogs depot showed a decrease in the number of CD16 and an increase of CD11b cells after treatment.CONCLUSION(S): The use of interferon alpha-2b within the peritoneal cavity after conservative surgery may be inappropriate because it increased later recurrence of endometriosis. The postoperative treatment with GnRH analogs did not significantly reduce the recurrence rate. Immunoglobulins and lymphocyte populations did not change in relation to the recurrence of endometriosis.",

    "title": "The co-solvent Cremophor EL limits absorption of orally administered paclitaxel in cancer patients.",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the co-solvents Cremophor EL and polysorbate 80 on the absorption of orally administered paclitaxel. 6 patients received in a randomized setting, one week apart oral paclitaxel 60 mg m(-2) dissolved in polysorbate 80 or Cremophor EL. For 3 patients the amount of Cremophor EL was 5 ml m(-2), for the other three 15 ml m(-2). Prior to paclitaxel administration patients received 15 mg kg(-1) oral cyclosporin A to enhance the oral absorption of the drug. Paclitaxel formulated in polysorbate 80 resulted in a significant increase in the maximal concentration (C(max)) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of paclitaxel in comparison with the Cremophor EL formulations (P = 0.046 for both parameters). When formulated in Cremophor EL 15 ml m(-2), paclitaxel C(max) and AUC values were 0.10 +/- 0.06 microM and 1.29 +/- 0.99 microM h(-1), respectively, whereas these values were 0.31 +/- 0.06 microM and 2.61 +/- 1.54 microM h(-1), respectively, when formulated in polysorbate 80. Faecal data revealed a decrease in excretion of unchanged paclitaxel for the polysorbate 80 formulation compared to the Cremophor EL formulations. The amount of paclitaxel excreted in faeces was significantly correlated with the amount of Cremophor EL excreted in faeces (P = 0.019). When formulated in Cremophor EL 15 ml m(-2), paclitaxel excretion in faeces was 38.8 +/- 13.0% of the administered dose, whereas this value was 18.3 +/-15.5% for the polysorbate 80 formulation. The results show that the co-solvent Cremophor EL is an important factor limiting the absorption of orally administered paclitaxel from the intestinal lumen. They highlight the need for designing a better drug formulation in order to increase the usefulness of the oral route of paclitaxel",

    "abstract": "Virosomal vaccines were prepared by extracting hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase from influenza virus and incorporating it in the membranes of liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine. Two intranasal spray vaccine series were prepared: one series comprised 7.5 micrograms of HA of each of three strains recommended by the World Health Organization and 1 microgram of Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin (HLT), and the other contained the HA without HLT. In addition, a third vaccine preparation contained 15 micrograms of HA and 2 micrograms of HLT. The parenteral virosomal vaccine contained 15 micrograms of HA without additional adjuvant. The immunogenicity of a single spray vaccination (15 micrograms of HA and 2 micrograms of HLT) was compared with that of two vaccinations (7.5 micrograms of HA with or without 1 microgram of HLT) with an interval of 1 week in 60 healthy working adults. Twenty volunteers received one parenteral virosomal vaccine. Two nasal spray vaccinations with HLT-adjuvanted virosomal influenza vaccine induced a humoral immune response which was comparable to that with a single parenteral vaccination. A significantly higher induction of influenza virus-specific immunoglobulin A was noted in the saliva after two nasal applications. The immune response after a single spray vaccination was significantly lower. It could be shown that the use of HLT as a mucosal adjuvant is necessary to obtain a humoral immune response comparable to that with parenteral vaccination. All vaccines were well tolerated.",

Photodynamic therapy has been used clinically for malignant conditions and is being investigated for dysplastic lesions of the lower genital tract and for endometrial ablation. Laser welding has potential, but further work is required in this field before it finds a clinical application. The main lasers used in gynecology are CO2, neodymium-yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), and potassium tatanyl-phosphate-doubled Nd:YAG. Pulsed Ho:YAG laser looks promising, as does diode lasers. Holmium-yttrium aluminum garnet and diode lasers will be soon available commercially. Improvements in delivery systems have increased user friendliness, and more developments in this area are anticipated, for example, a fiber-optic delivery system for CO2 lasers. We believe that enhanced understanding of laser technology will provide unique applications for development in gynecology.",

    "title": "A controlled clinical study of the effect of nasal immunization with a Streptococcus mutans antigen alone or incorporated into liposomes on induction of immune responses.",
    "abstract": "Recent attention to mucosal immunization strategies has been focused on the nasal route for vaccine delivery. This study was designed to determine the effectiveness of a liposome-protein vaccine compared to that of a protein-only vaccine in inducing immune responses in humans. Healthy subjects were randomly assigned to two groups and immunized intranasally with a crude antigen preparation rich in glucosyltransferase (C-GTF) from Streptococcus mutans, alone or in liposomes. Parotid saliva, nasal wash, and serum were collected prior to and at weekly intervals following immunization and were analyzed for anti-C-GTF activity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-C-GTF activity in the nasal wash from both groups after immunization increased to a mean peak of fivefold over the baseline level on day 28. Salivary IgA anti-C-GTF responses were induced to a lesser extent. IgG and IgA anti-C-GTF responses in serum were detected on day 14. The IgA responses were predominantly of the IgA1 subclass. These results show that C-GTF vaccines were more effective in inducing a local secretory IgA antibody response than a salivary or serum response when they were given intranasally. The IgA1 anti-C-GTF response in nasal wash samples for liposomal antigen versus antigen only was the only response which was significantly different (P < 0.04). This suggests that the form of the antigen affects the magnitude of the local mucosal response but not that of a disseminated response. These results provide evidence for the effective use of a nasal protein vaccine in humans for the induction of mucosal and systemic responses.",

    "abstract": "TAP-144-SR (3M) is a 3-month sustained releasing injection of a super-active agonist of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LH-RH), leuprorelin acetate. At the Department of Urology of Gunma University Hospital, TAP-144-SR (3M) was injected once subcutaneously into 10 prostatic cancer patients who had had no treatment in the past to investigate safety, serum testosterone levels, drug concentrations and efficacy. In safety, no problematic adverse reactions occurred, and the drug was well tolerated. Serum testosterone levels elevated temporarily up to 2 days after injection and then were reduced rapidly. The levels were reduced below the castration level (100 ng/dl) after 3 weeks and then remained reduced up to 12 weeks. Serum TAP-144 levels including metabolite M-I, elevated to maximal plasma concentration up to 3 hours after injection and then were maintained at about 0.2 ng/ml between 1 week and 12 weeks after injection. With respect to the anti-tumor effects, the response rate according to \"criteria of prostate cancer\" at 12 weeks after injection was 100% (stable response cases) and the ratio of PSA normalization at 12 weeks was 90%. These results showed that an injection of TAP-144-SR (3M) was well tolerated in prostate cancer patients having no prior treatment and inhibited serum testosterone persisting for at least 12 weeks so that TAP-144-SR (3M) was concluded to be safe and clinically effective for prostate cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness and safety of long-term depot leuprolide acetate (GnRH-a) plus estrogen and progestin add-back therapy in the treatment of moderate and severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS).DESIGN: A prospective trial with each patient serving as her own control.SETTING: University teaching hospital.PARTICIPANTS: Ten women with regular menstrual cycles complaining of moderate to severe PMS. Premenstrual syndrome was diagnosed when symptoms increased > or = 25% during the luteal phase.TREATMENT: Four-week cycles of IM injections of placebo or GnRH-a with all patients receiving saline (placebo), the first cycle followed by 12 cycles of GnRH-a, 7.5 mg. Conjugated equine estrogen (0.625 mg/d) was started Monday through Saturday within the first cycle and increased as needed. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), 10 mg/d, was taken orally for 10 days after 4, 8, and 12 cycles of GnRH-a therapy.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in three symptom categories (water retention, pain, and psychological function), serum levels of total cholesterol and HDL, HDL-2, and LDL cholesterol, E2, and estrone. Endometrial biopsy was obtained 1 day after the end of the 12th GnRH-a cycle, and bone density was assessed using quantitative computer tomography at the end of the 12th GnRH-a cycle.RESULTS: During treatment, there was a significant decrease compared with baseline and placebo in all three symptom categories. There were no significant changes in lipids. Endometrial biopsies revealed progestational changes with no evidence of hyperplasia. Quantitative computer tomography bone density dropped 3.7 on average compared with baseline after 12 months of treatment, but this was not statistically significant.CONCLUSION: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy with hormonal add-back therapy is effective in treating PMS symptoms with progressive improvement over a 12-month period. This therapy prevents changes in lipids and adequately protects the endometrium with the addition of MPA every 4th cycle. Quantitative computer tomography bone density dropped at 12 months; further examination of bone changes is necessary.",

Of 66 patients entered 60 are eligible and evaluable; their median age was 45, estrogen receptor (ER) was positive in 9, negative in 11 and unknown in 40. The median disease free interval (DFI) was 11 months. Metastatic sites were visceral in 14, bone in 34 and soft tissue in 37. Twenty-nine patients had metastatic disease of one site, while 31 had 2-4 sites. An objective response of 82% was documented (29 complete responders and 20 partial responders). Median time to treatment failure was 11.5 months and median survival 37 months. Most commonly encountered side effects attributable to CAF were alopecia, nausea and vomiting, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. Side effects attributable to buserelin were hot flashes. After one cycle baseline mean serum estradiol fell from premenopausal levels to postmenopausal levels. This study showed that CAF plus buserelin is well tolerated, with a very high response rate in selected premenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the levels of cytokines in the follicular fluid of stimulated ovaries.DESIGN: The study included two groups of four patients with polycystic ovarian disease. These were diagnosed by clinical and ultrasonic features and characteristic hormonal profiles, treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone-analogue and human menopausal gonadotropin. One group received dexamethasone (DEX).MAIN OUTCOME: Dexamethasone is capable of directly affecting granulosa and immune cells. It was also expected to affect cytokine production of granulosa and immune cells of the ovary.RESULTS: This study demonstrates that FF from patients treated with DEX has reduced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity and elevated colony-stimulating factor levels. Regardless of the treatment with DEX, the follicles with high levels of TNF contained minimal concentrations of estradiol. Interleukin-6 did not differ between the FF samples.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a role for cytokines in the process of folliculogenesis and ovarian maturation. Modification of cytokines by DEX might explain the beneficial effect of fertility.",

    "abstract": "Sixty-one women undergoing major gynaecological surgery received slow release morphine (MST) 60 mg, with placebo, hyoscine 0.6 mg or diazepam 10 mg, by mouth 2 h before surgery. Plasma morphine concentrations reached a steady level usually within 3 h after administration of MST, and did not increase after surgery unless supplementary opioid was given. Hyoscine delayed morphine absorption. Before operation no fewer than 50% of patients were sedated after MST alone, but this increased to 85% after MST and diazepam. Similarly, only the combination MST and diazepam produced anxiolysis. Postoperative mood was unhappier after MST and hyoscine. Emesis occurred in 40-57% of patients, and was not reduced by hyoscine. Therefore premedication with MST alone did not produce reliable sedation or anxiolysis. A combination of hyoscine and MST premedication cannot be recommended, as it did not produce sedation, anxiolysis or antiemesis and hyoscine may have delayed morphine absorption.",

    "title": "Treatment of periodontitis by local administration of minocycline microspheres: a controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is an inflammatory condition of tooth-supporting tissues that is usually treated by mechanical removal of plaque and microorganisms that adhere to teeth. This treatment, known as scaling and root planing, is not optimally effective. Adjunctive therapy with locally delivered antimicrobials has resulted in improved clinical outcomes such as probing depth reduction. This article reports on the efficacy and safety of locally administered microencapsulated minocycline.METHODS: Seven hundred forty-eight (748) patients with moderate to advanced periodontitis were enrolled in a multi-center trial and randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: 1) scaling and root planing (SRP) alone; 2) SRP plus vehicle; or 3) SRP plus minocycline microspheres. The primary outcome measure was probing depth reduction at 9 months. Clinical assessments were performed at baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 9 months.RESULTS: Minocycline microspheres plus scaling and root planing provided substantially more probing depth reduction than either SRP alone or SRP plus vehicle. The difference reached statistical significance after the first month and was maintained throughout the trial. The improved outcome was observed to be independent of patients' smoking status, age, gender, or baseline disease level. There was no difference in the incidence of adverse effects among treatment groups.CONCLUSIONS: Scaling and root planing plus minocycline microspheres is more effective than scaling and root planing alone in reducing probing depths in periodontitis patients.",

One thousand and twenty-two women of mixed parity underwent color flow/pulsed Doppler (CFPD) imaging of the uterine arteries at the time of the 17-23 week (mean 19.9) anomaly scan. Women who were screen positive were randomized to a control or treatment group. The treatment group was given 100-mg slow-release aspirin (Disprin CV) daily and followed up at regular intervals. Women in the routine group received routine antenatal care. Main outcome measures were pre-eclampsia and SGA < 3rd centile. Secondary outcome measures were: SGA < 10th centile, pre-eclampsia requiring delivery before 34 weeks, placental abruption, an Apgar score < 7 at 5 min, admission to neonatal intensive care unit or a pregnancy that resulted in a stillbirth or neonatal death. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for severe and any complications.RESULTS: Two hundred and sixteen women were screen positive according to the defined criteria. One hundred and three women were assigned to the treatment group and 113 to the control group. The difference in the incidence of pre-eclampsia and SGA < 3rd centile between the control and treatment groups did not reach statistical significance. There was a statistically significant reduction in any (OR 0.41 (CI 0.35-0.45), P < 0.01) and severe pregnancy complications (OR 0.43 (CI 0.21-0.84), P < 0.05) in the treatment group compared with the controls.CONCLUSIONS: The administration of slow-release aspirin to women identified as high risk, using color Doppler imaging of the uterine arteries at 20 weeks' gestation, did not significantly alter the incidence of pre-eclampsia or delivery of a SGA baby. It did, however, improve the outcome by reducing the overall incidence of complications associated with uteroplacental insufficiency.",

    "title": "Comparative anatomy of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily.",
    "abstract": "The aldo-keto reductases metabolize a wide range of substrates and are potential drug targets. This protein superfamily includes aldose reductases, aldehyde reductases, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases and dihydrodiol dehydrogenases. By combining multiple sequence alignments with known three-dimensional structures and the results of site-directed mutagenesis studies, we have developed a structure/function analysis of this superfamily. Our studies suggest that the (alpha/beta)8-barrel fold provides a common scaffold for an NAD(P)(H)-dependent catalytic activity, with substrate specificity determined by variation of loops on the C-terminal side of the barrel. All the aldo-keto reductases are dependent on nicotinamide cofactors for catalysis and retain a similar cofactor binding site, even among proteins with less than 30% amino acid sequence identity. Likewise, the aldo-keto reductase active site is highly conserved. However, our alignments indicate that variation ofa single residue in the active site may alter the reaction mechanism from carbonyl oxidoreduction to carbon-carbon double-bond reduction, as in the 3-oxo-5beta-steroid 4-dehydrogenases (Delta4-3-ketosteroid 5beta-reductases) of the superfamily. Comparison of the proposed substrate binding pocket suggests residues 54 and 118, near the active site, as possible discriminators between sugar and steroid substrates. In addition, sequence alignment and subsequent homology modelling of mouse liver 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and rat ovary 20alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase indicate that three loops on the C-terminal side of the barrel play potential roles in determining the positional and stereo-specificity of the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. Finally, we propose that the aldo-keto reductase superfamily may represent an example of divergent evolution from an ancestral multifunctional oxidoreductase and an example of convergent evolution to the same active-site constellation as the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily.",

    "abstract": "Many companies are now prioritizing the development of dry powder inhalers (DPIs) above pressurized formulations of asthma drugs. A well-designed DPI and an appropriate powder formulation can optimize the effectiveness of inhaled drug therapy. A DPI must be able to deliver medications effectively for most patients, and an ideal inhaler would provide a dose that does not vary with inspiratory flow rate. Recent regulatory guidelines, among which the U.S. FDA draft guidance is the most stringent, demand consistent dose delivery from an inhaler throughout its life and consistency of doses from one inhaler to another. However, the properties of free micronized powders often interfere with drug handling and with drug delivery reducing dose consistency. Recent advances in formulation technology can increase lung dose and reduce its variability. While a perfect DPI may never exist, both device and formulation technology are evolving to rectify perceived deficiencies in earlier systems.",

Since the factors that determine tissue drug concentrations are unknown we have studied the relationships between the oral dose of delayed-release mesalazine, rectal tissue drug concentrations and standard pharmacokinetic parameters.METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers were studied following 7 days treatment with 1.2, 2.4 and 4.8 g of delayed-release mesalazine daily. 5-aminosalicylic acid and N-acetyl 5-aminosalicylic acid concentrations were measured in serum, urine, stool and rectal tissue biopsies.RESULTS: Serum concentrations and 24 h urinary excretion of 5ASA and N-acetyl 5ASA increased as the oral dose of mesalazine was increased from 1.2 g through 2.4 g to 4.8 g daily (serum area under curve (AUC):5ASA = 3. 9, 15.4 and 46.8 microg ml-1 h, P < 0.0001; N-acetyl 5ASA = 17.2, 30. 9 and 57.8 microg ml-1 h, P < 0.0001: urinary excretion: 5ASA = 1.8, 85.5 and 445 mg, P < 0.0001; N-acetyl 5ASA = 250, 524 and 1468 mg, P < 0.0001, respectively). Faecal 5ASA excretion increased as the oral dose increased from 1.2 g to 2.4 g but did not increase further with 4.8 g daily dosing whereas faecal N-acetyl 5ASA excretion was similar at all three doses. Rectal tissue concentrations of 5ASA increased markedly, and N-acetyl 5ASA increased modestly, as the dose of oral mesalazine increased from 1.2 g to 2.4 g daily but neither increased further with 4.8 g daily dosing.CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between the ingested dose of delayed-release mesalazine and rectal tissue drug concentrations is complex.

This study was designed to evaluate the responses to three stressors and to determine if once-daily sustained release verapamil (Verelan) modified these responses. We studied 13 patients with mild to moderate hypertension in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. After 4 weeks of therapy, patients were evaluated following assumption of the upright posture, mental stress, and cold pressor test. During placebo, the stressors produced an increase in systolic pressure (144 +/- 2 to 167 +/- 3 mmHg, p < 0.001), heart rate (70 +/- 2 to 77 +/- 2 beats/ min, p < 0.001), and platelet aggregability to adenosine diphosphate (threshold concentration fell from 2.8 +/- 0.4 to 1.9 +/- 0.1 microM, p = 0.05) and epinephrine (3.4 +/- 0.9 to 1.6 +/- 0.6 microM, p < 0.001). Verapamil lowered systolic pressure at baseline (144 +/- 2 to 134 +/- 2 mmHg, p < 0.001), and after stress (167 +/- 3 to 154 +/- 3 mmHg, p < 0.001), but did not alter the absolute increase with stress. During verapamil, platelet reactivity did not increase with stress, and the post-stress response to epinephrine was reduced (higher threshold concentration) compared with placebo (3.9 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.3 microM, p = 0.05). Verapamil also reduced the response to collagen (increased lag time) at baseline and after stress (111 +/- 9 vs. 91 +/- 3 s, p < 0.01). We conclude that verapamil blunted potentially harmful stress-induced hemodynamic and hemostatic changes. Further studies are required to determine whether these effects translate into a lower incidence of acute cardiovascular events.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacodynamics (PD), anti-tumor effects, safety and pharmacokinetics of a 3-month formulation of goserelin (Zoladex LA 10.8 mg depot: \"10.8 mg depot\") were investigated in a collaborative multicenter study. Study participants were 40 Japanese patients with prostate cancer comprising 20 untreated patients and 20 switch patients who had been receiving Zoladex 3.6 mg depot for 3 months or longer. Serum testosterone levels, serum LH levels, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and drug concentrations were measured until 12 weeks after a single subcutaneous dose of 10.8 mg depot. Anti-tumor effects were evaluated by means of changes in the tumor lesions and the PSA levels at 12 weeks. After administration to the untreated patients, 10.8 mg depot reduced serum testosterone to the castrate range within 4 weeks and the reduction was maintained for up to 12 weeks. In the switch patients, serum testosterone suppression that had been produced by previous treatment with Zoladex 3.6 mg depot was maintained for up to 12 weeks following 10.8 mg depot administration. The anti-tumor effect at 12 weeks was 90.0% including partial response cases. The ratio of PSA normalization at 12 weeks was 75.0%. Fifty-seven adverse reactions were observed in 27 of the 40 patients (67.5%), but none were clinically significant. Although a disease flare presented as urinary retention in 1 of the untreated patients, all patients completed the study. Serum goserelin was detected up to 12 weeks after the administration of 10.8 mg depot. In conclusion a single dose of 10.8 mg depot showed a satisfactory PD-effect and brought about clinical efficacy persisting for at least 12 weeks and was well tolerated in patients with prostate cancer.",

    "title": "Effects of two different somatostatin analogs on glucose tolerance in acromegaly.",
    "abstract": "Impaired glucose tolerance is present in many acromegalic patients and treatment with somatostatin analogs has variable effects on glycemic control. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of 2 somatostatin analogs on glucose metabolism, lanreotide slow release (L-SR) and octreotide long acting release (O-LAR), in 10 patients with acromegaly (2 of whom with overt Type 2 diabetes mellitus). Glucose and insulin levels in fasting conditions and in response to OGTT, evaluated as AUC, insulin resistance (IR) evaluated by homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), GH, IGF-I, were assessed during L-SR and O-LAR treatment. Mean fasting glucose, glucose response to OGTT and HbA1c levels in 8 non-diabetic patients did not significantly change after L-SR therapy while they all increased after O-LAR treatment (p<0.05 vs baseline and L-SR). Mean HOMA-IR values calculated in acromegalic patients before medical therapy were higher than in normal subjects (p<0.005) and showed a significant decrease during both treatments (p<0.05). In the 2 diabetic acromegalic patients a worsening in glucose metabolism was observed during O-LAR treatment but not during L-SR. GH and IGF-I levels significantly decreased with both drugs and normalized respectively in 38% and 12% with L-SR, 50% and 25% with O-LAR. In conclusion, both drugs decreased IR in acromegalic patients; O-LAR seems to be more detrimental to glucose metabolism than L-SR, despite being more effective in reducing GH and IGF-I levels.",

    "title": "Dose-dependent increase of saquinavir bioavailability by the pharmaceutic aid cremophor EL.",
    "abstract": "AIMS: Bioavailability of orally administered drugs depends on several factors including active excretion, e.g. by P-glycoprotein (PGP), and presystemic metabolism, e.g. by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A), in both gastrointestinal tract and liver. Many drugs including saquinavir are substrates of both PGP and CYP3A. It was the aim of this study to test whether the extremely low bioavailability of saquinavir can be increased dose-dependently in vivo by cremophor EL, an 'inactive' pharmaceutic aid known to inhibit PGP in vitro.METHODS: In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, four phase cross-over design single doses of oral saquinavir (Invirase, 600 mg, without food) were administered with increasing single doses of oral cremophor EL (up to 5000 mg) to eight healthy, male individuals. Saquinavir plasma concentrations were determined by LC/MS/MS up to 48 h after intake. Main outcome measures were area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC), peak concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t(1/2)).RESULTS: Cremophor EL dose-dependently increased Cmax, AUC(0,4 h), and AUC(0,infinity) of saquinavir. As compared with placebo, the increment observed after 5000 mg cremophor EL was 13-fold for both Cmax and AUC(0,4 h) and 5-fold for AUC(0,infinity). The terminal half-life and the time to reach Cmax (tmax) were unchanged.CONCLUSIONS: Cremophor EL increased the systemic availability of saquinavir without affecting its elimination suggesting that cremophor EL is not devoid of pharmacological action and acts as a modulator of the absorption process, probably by inhibiting intestinal PGP.",

    "title": "BACKGROUND: The antithrombotic efficacy of aspirin is attributed to its inhibition of the enzyme prostaglandin G/H synthase, which is necessary for the formation of thromboxane A2 in platelets. Thromboxane A2 is a potent vasoconstrictor and platelet agonist. However, the formation of prostacyclin by vascular endothelium also requires prostaglandin G/H synthase, and prostacyclin exerts opposite effects on platelet function and vascular tone. We wanted to see whether controlled-release aspirin would affect the formation of thromboxane A2 but not prostacyclin by reducing the aspirin concentration that reaches the posthepatic circulation.METHODS: A controlled-release formulation containing 75 mg of aspirin, designed to release 10 mg per hour, was developed to inhibit prostaglandin G/H synthase in platelets in the prehepatic circulation. The effects of the controlled-release preparation on plasma levels of aspirin and salicylate, serum levels of thromboxane B2, and urinary dinor metabolites of prostacyclin and thromboxane B2 (measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) were compared with those of conventional immediate-release aspirin in normal volunteers. Prostacyclin release was stimulated by intravenous bradykinin.RESULTS: Steady-state inhibition of serum thromboxane B2 required two to four days and appeared slower with 75 mg of controlled-release than with the same amount of immediate-release aspirin. Maximal inhibition was achieved rapidly by adding a single loading dose of 162.5 mg of immediate-release aspirin to the regimen. Over a 28-day period, suppression of thromboxane A2 with this regimen was comparable to that with immediate-release aspirin taken either as 162.5 mg daily or as 325 mg on alternate days, despite the minimal systemic bioavailability of controlled-release aspirin. Bleeding time was prolonged to a similar degree with each of the three regimens. The five- to sixfold increase in the prostacyclin metabolite induced by bradykinin was depressed by pretreatment for four days with 75 mg of immediate-release aspirin, but not by 75 mg of controlled-release aspirin.CONCLUSIONS: Maximal inhibition of platelet thromboxane A2 production was sustained during long-term dosing with controlled-release aspirin, whereas basal prostacyclin biosynthesis fell only slightly and systemic synthesis of prostacyclin stimulated by bradykinin was preserved. Controlled-release aspirin may facilitate determination of the clinical importance of preserving prostacyclin during platelet inhibition in humans.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Entacapone is a specific, potent, peripherally acting catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. It has been shown to improve the bioavailability of plasma levodopa and extend its clinical effect when used as an adjunct to standard levodopa preparations, but there is little experience of the effect of entacapone on controlled release levodopa preparations.METHODS: A double blind, placebo controlled, single dose, randomised, cross over trial was performed in 14 patients with Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations to investigate the clinical effect of a single dose of entacapone (200 mg) when administered with either standard levodopa-carbidopa (Sinemet) or controlled release levodopa-carbidopa preparations (Sinemet CR).RESULTS: When entacapone was administered with standard Sinemet the duration of the clinical response to standard Sinemet was longer in comparison with the response after placebo (p=0.02). Moreover, in the same patients, entacapone significantly increased the duration of the clinical response to Sinemet CR (p=0.05) without prolonging the latency of response or enhancing dyskinesias.CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the clinical efficacy of entacapone-standard Sinemet combination. They also indicate that adding entacapone to controlled release levodopa preparations might provide a useful treatment option in patients with Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations. A double blind clinical trial with a chronically administered entacapone-Sinemet CR combination is, however, required to verify this viewpoint.",

    "title": "An oral formulation of nicotine for release and absorption in the colon: its development and pharmacokinetics.",
    "abstract": "AIMS: Ulcerative colitis is predominantly a disease of nonsmokers and transdermal nicotine has therapeutic value in active disease; however side-effects are troublesome. The aim of this study was to develop an oral formulation of nicotine which would be slowly released in the colon over 6 h, and to examine its pharmacokinetic profile in 12 healthy volunteers, with measurements of serum nicotine and cotinine, its principal metabolite.METHODS: Nicotine was combined with a polyacrylic carbomer, Carbopol 974P which was incorporated into 13 different vehicles and their release profiles examined in vitro. The polyglycolized glyceride, Gelucire 50/13, was chosen for subsequent kinetic studies because it consistently produced a suitable release pattern which was linear. Capsules containing 3 mg nicotine, combined with carbomer in Gelucire 50/13, were coated with an acrylic resin Eudragit L; this ensured the capsule would remain intact until the ileum. On 2 separate days, 6 and 15 mg nicotine, contained in 2 and 5 capsules, respectively, were administered to 12 subjects, all nonsmokers, mean age 28 years. Serial blood measurements were taken for 36 h, serum nicotine and cotinine concentrations were measured by gas liquid chromatography.RESULTS: There was considerable intersubject variability in the nicotine and cotinine values. Plasma nicotine levels began to rise about 4 h after ingestion of the capsules, corresponding with the oro-caecal transit time. Cmax nicotine values were 2.2 and 5 ng ml-1, obtained 7 h after the ingestion of 6 and 15 mg, respectively, of the formulation. The corresponding Cmax values for cotinine were 37 and 94.4 ng ml-1, occurring after 9-10 h. The mean for elimination half-lives in the 24 studies, including the 6 and 15 mg doses, for nicotine were 4.3+/-2.7 h and for cotinine 16.8+/-7.5 h. With 6 mg nicotine-carbomer, only 1 of 12 volunteers had possible side-effects, but with the 15 mg dose 11 out of the 12 reported adverse effects which were systemic or gastrointestinal in nature-their timing corresponded with peak serum concentrations of nicotine.CONCLUSIONS: An oral formulation of nicotine has been developed; in the ileum and colon, this becomes available for slow linear release over 6 h and delivers high concentrations of nicotine for topical effect on the colon. 6 mg Nicotine was well tolerated, whilst 15 mg gave both systemic and gastrointestinal side-effects. High concentrations of topical nicotine in the colon are achieved with relatively low systemic bioavailablity-reflected by the Cmax and AUC values for nicotine. This, or comparable formulations, may be of therapeutic value in ulcerative colitis.",

    "title": "Role and regulation of activator protein-1 in toxicant-induced responses of the lung.",
    "abstract": "Aberrant cell proliferation and differentiation after toxic injury to airway epithelium can lead to the development of various lung diseases including cancer. The activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor, composed of mainly Jun-Jun and Jun-Fos protein dimers, acts as an environmental biosensor to various external toxic stimuli and regulates gene expression involved in various biological processes. Gene disruption studies indicate that the AP-1 family members c-jun, junB, and fra1 are essential for embryonic development, whereas junD, c-fos, and fosB are required for normal postnatal growth. However, broad or target-specific transgenic overexpression of the some of these proteins gives very distinct phenotype(s), including tumor formation. This implies that, although they are required for normal cellular processes, their abnormal activation after toxic injury can lead to the pathogenesis of the lung disease. Consistent with this view, various environmental toxicants and carcinogens differentially regulate Jun and Fos expression in cells of the lung both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, Jun and Fos proteins distinctly bind to the promoter regions of a wide variety of genes to differentially regulate their expression in epithelial injury, repair, and differentiation. Importantly, lung tumors induced by various carcinogens display a sustained expression of certain AP-1 family members. Therefore a better understanding of the mechanisms of regulation and functional role(s), as well as identification of target genes of members of the AP-1 family in airway epithelial cells, will provide additional insight into toxicant-induced lung diseases. These studies might offer a unique opportunity to use AP-1 family members and transactivation as potential diagnostic markers or drug targets for early detection and/or prevention of various lung diseases.",

    "title": "Social and legal factors related to drug abuse in the United States and Japan.",
    "abstract": "This article is an overview of social and legal differences in the United States and in Japan that are related to patterns of current drug abuse epidemics in these countries. These two nations have drug abuse problems with different histories and take different approaches currently to handling illicit drug marketing and use. Histories of opiate and cocaine abuse in the United States and of stimulant and inhalant abuse in Japan are discussed. The United States has experienced three heroin epidemics in the last three decades; cocaine addiction began to merit national concern by the end of the 1980s. In Japan, the first methamphetamine epidemic began after World War II; it was controlled in the 1950s. The current inhalant epidemic began in the late 1960s and was followed by the second methamphetamine epidemic that began in 1970; both are continuing to the present. The criminal justice system is always given first consideration when assessing societal measures employed to reduce drug use. Legal penalties for illicit drug offenses reflect the societal differences of these two nations with respect to the seriousness of particular types of crimes. Characteristics of the health care system of a nation may also influence patterns of drug abuse, particularly where functions of criminal justice and health care systems overlap. Health care systems in the United States and in Japan are based on different treatment philosophies and patients' expectations; these differences are discussed along with explanations of their potential influence on the epidemiology of drug abuse.",

    "abstract": "A comparison of aerosol delivery has been made between two open-vent Pari jet nebulizers. Intermittent and continuous delivery were compared for one of the nebulizers. Ten healthy volunteers inhaled 99mTc-labelled diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) aerosols on three occasions. The Pari LC device was operated both intermittently (by a manual interrupter that generated aerosol only in synchrony with inhalation) and continuously. The Pari LL nebulizer was operated only in the intermittent mode. A system of inspiratory and expiratory valves was fitted to each nebulizer in order to direct airflow. Both nebulizers were powered by Pari Boy compressors. The mean (SD) whole lung deposition for the LL nebulizer was 11.1 (4.0)% of the nominal dose, compared to 15.3 (12.8)% and 12.8 (7.9)% for the LC used with intermittent and continuous operation, respectively. These differences were not statistically significant. Regional deposition patterns within the lungs were similar for the three nebulizer systems. These data show that efficient nebulizer systems using relatively low power compressors are possible, and suggest that continuously operated open-vent nebulizers may be designed to give lung deposition comparable to that achieved by nebulizers fitted with manual interrupters.",

    "title": "Liposomal vincristine in relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphomas: early results of an ongoing phase II trial.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Vincristine is an active agent in lymphomas, but is often neurotoxic, and the resulting dose reductions have been associated with lower remission and survival rates in Hodgkin's disease. Liposomal vincristine (Onco-TCS) has prolonged half-life, reaches higher concentration in tumors and lymph nodes than in nerves, and administered at full doses appears to be less neurotoxic, and more active then free vincristine in mice bearing L-1210 and P-388 leukemias. We therefore explored its activity in relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had histologically proven relapse, age > or = 16 years, normal renal function, neutrophils > 500/microliter, platelets > 50,000/microliter, and no HIV infection, central nervous system disease, or serious neuropathy. Patients were treated with 2.0 mg/m2 of liposomal vincristine i.v. over 60 minutes q 14 days. Responders received up to 12 injections.RESULTS: Of the 51 registered patients, 35 are currently evaluable for response. Median age was 62 years (range 19-86), and 21 were male. The median number of prior regimens was 3 (range 1-10) and had included vincristine in all patients, of whom 51% were refractory to their last regimen. Serum LDH was high in 46%, and beta 2-microglobulin > 3.0 mg/l in 63% of patients. Of the 155 administered injections, 138 (89%) were at the 2.0 mg/m2 level. The median injected dose was 3.8 mg (range 2.6-4.8 mg), and median number of injections was 4 (range 1-12). Responses were seen in 14 of 34 (41%) patients with NHL (95% confidence intervals (95% CI) 25%-59%). Response rates were 10% for indolent, 71% for transformed, and 47% for aggressive NHL, but the 95% confidence intervals overlapped. Median progression-free survival was 5.5 months for responders. Grade 3-4 motor or sensory neuropathy was seen in 11, and caused termination of therapy in five patients. All five had prior neuropathy, two had previously received paclitaxel, one platinum, and two paclitaxel and platinum. Fever was detected in three patients, but there were no toxic deaths.CONCLUSIONS: Liposomal vincristine is active and well tolerated in this heavily pretreated population with relapsed NHL, but can be neurotoxic in a fraction of patients heavily exposed to prior neurotoxic agents. These data, if confirmed, would suggest a potential role for liposomal vincristine in the combination therapy of previously untreated patients with NHL.",

TAP-144-SR was injected subcutaneously every four weeks for twelve weeks, and clinical symptoms and plasma and urinary levels of various hormones were followed every four weeks. Eleven girls given 10 micrograms/kg showed a significant decrease in peak plasma LH and FSH responses to LH-RH test, but basal plasma LH and FSH did not change significantly. In 13 patients (11 girls and 2 boys) given 30 micrograms/kg and 12 girls given 90 micrograms/kg, both basal and peak LH and FSH were significantly suppressed. Urinary excretion of LH decreased significantly in all groups except in the 10 micrograms/kg group. Urinary excretion of FSH did not change significantly in the 10 and 30 micrograms/kg groups, but it decreased significantly in the 90 micrograms/kg group. In girls, plasma and urinary estradiol also fell greatly, but the difference was insignificant except in the 90 micrograms/kg group. Regression of sexual characteristics was observed in almost half of the patients at the 12th week of the treatment. Side effects were minimal. A dose of more than 30 micrograms/kg of TAP-144-SR is effective in suppressing gonadotropins and causing improvement of clinical symptoms, and appears to be useful in treating children with central precocious puberty.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of bupropion sustained-release (bupropion SR) in reducing weight and depressive symptoms in obese adults.RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Obese adults (body mass index, 30 to 44 kg/m(2)) not currently meeting criteria for major depression but with depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory score 10-30) received bupropion SR 300 mg/d or placebo for 26 weeks with a 500 kcal/d-deficit diet. Patients who lost <5% of baseline weight at week 12 had bupropion SR dosage or placebo increased to 400 mg/d in a blinded fashion.RESULTS: The bupropion SR group (n = 193) lost an average of 4.4 kg (4.6% of baseline weight) vs. 1.7 kg (1.8% of baseline weight) on placebo (n = 191, p < 0.001, last-observation-carried-forward analysis). More patients in the bupropion SR group than in the placebo group (40% vs. 16% of intent-to-treat sample, 50% vs. 28% of completers, respectively) lost at least 5% of baseline weight (p < 0.05 at week 4, p < 0.001 at weeks 6 to 26). The percentage of patients reporting > or =50% decrease in depressive symptoms did not differ between groups, but depressive symptoms improved more with bupropion SR than with placebo among patients with a history of major depression (p < 0.05, weeks 4 to 26). In the sample as a whole, improvement in depressive symptoms was related to weight loss of > or =5% regardless of treatment (p < 0.0001).

The effects on blood pressure and on echocardiographic LV functional parameters were also analysed. After two months of randomized treatment with Nifedipine GITS or HCTZ, if diastolic blood pressure was > 90 mmHg, a combination of the two drugs was given and was continued for 24 weeks. M-mode, 2D-guided echocardiography was used to measure LV mass index (LVMI) according to the \"Penn convention\". Minimal vascular resistance was measured in the forearm, from arterial pressure and maximal blood flow, using a strain gauge plethysmography. All examinations were performed before and after 8 and 24 weeks of treatment. Changes in LVMI were analysed at 8 weeks and at 24 weeks in patients receiving monotherapy (\"according to protocol\" analysis), and also at the end of treatment in patients taking Nifedipine or HCTZ monotherapy or the combination of the two drugs (\"intention to treat\" analysis). Both Nifedipine and HCTZ significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), without any significant difference between the two drug treatments. Heart rate was not significantly modified by either treatment. A progressive decrease in LVMI was observed after 8 and 24 weeks of treatment with Nifedipine monotherapy (ANOVA, p = 0.03), while the decrease in LVMI during HCTZ treatment did not progress further at 24 weeks (ANOVA, p = 0.49). A significant reduction of minimal vascular resistance was observed in patients treated with Nifedipine GITS monotherapy (ANOVA, p = 0.001), but not in the HCTZ group (ANOVA, p = 0.06). Comparison of changes of forearm minimal vascular resistance, considering baseline values, could demonstrate a greater effect during Nifedipine monotherapy as compared to HCTZ monotherapy. In conclusion, in a group of hypertensive patients with LVH, treatment for 24 weeks with Nifedipine GITS alone or in combination with HCTZ induced a significant reduction in LVMI and of forearm vascular structural changes, as evaluated by minimal vascular resistance. The decrease of minimal vascular resistance was significantly greater in patients treated with Nifedipine monotherapy, as compared to those given HCTZ.",

    "title": "Pneumococcal virulence factors: structure and function.",
    "abstract": "The overall goal for this review is to summarize the current body of knowledge about the structure and function of major known antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major gram-positive bacterial pathogen of humans. This information is then related to the role of these proteins in pneumococcal pathogenesis and in the development of new vaccines and/or other antimicrobial agents. S. pneumoniae is the most common cause of fatal community-acquired pneumonia in the elderly and is also one of the most common causes of middle ear infections and meningitis in children. The present vaccine for the pneumococcus consists of a mixture of 23 different capsular polysaccharides. While this vaccine is very effective in young adults, who are normally at low risk of serious disease, it is only about 60% effective in the elderly. In children younger than 2 years the vaccine is ineffective and is not recommended due to the inability of this age group to mount an antibody response to the pneumococcal polysaccharides. Antimicrobial drugs such as penicillin have diminished the risk from pneumococcal disease. Several pneumococcal proteins including pneumococcal surface proteins A and C, hyaluronate lyase, pneumolysin, autolysin, pneumococcal surface antigen A, choline binding protein A, and two neuraminidase enzymes are being investigated as potential vaccine or drug targets. Essentially all of these antigens have been or are being investigated on a structural level in addition to being characterized biochemically. Recently, three-dimensional structures for hyaluronate lyase and pneumococcal surface antigen A became available from X-ray crystallography determinations. Also, modeling studies based on biophysical measurements provided more information about the structures of pneumolysin and pneumococcal surface protein A. Structural and biochemical studies of these pneumococcal virulence factors have facilitated the development of novel antibiotics or protein antigen-based vaccines as an alternative to polysaccharide-based vaccines for the treatment of pneumococcal disease.",

    "title": "Particle uptake and translocation across epithelial membranes.",
    "abstract": "Oral delivery of drugs and vaccines has many advantages over other routes of administration. For example, for vaccination, enteric delivery may result in the induction of a mucosal immune response against pathogens which colonise and invade the mucosa. However, the oral delivery of peptide or protein drugs or antigens is beset with problems, such as gastrointestinal breakdown of labile molecules, low level of macromolecular absorption and, for vaccines, the poor immune response usually elicited by orally administered soluble antigens. Investigations are therefore in progress to develop means of increasing intestinal absorption and decreasing digestion of orally administered molecules. Molecules can be incorporated into biodegradable microparticles to reduce the effect of gut secretions and to enable the absorption of bioactive agents in an unaltered form. The uptake of microparticulates through the gut wall is accepted as a true biological phenomenon but the mechanism and route of uptake have not been established. Furthermore, in general, only small numbers of microparticles are translocated across epithelial membranes, possibly making these systems inappropriate for drug or vaccine delivery. This paper reviews particle uptake across the gastrointestinal tract and describes studies carried out to determine whether a humoral response can be elicited following oral administration of an antigen associated with biodegradable poly(DL lactide-coglycolide) microparticles. The use of lipid delivery vehicles to enhance microparticle uptake and the selective transport of microspheres across M cells is also described.",

Open administration of epidural morphine resulted in complete pain relief with minimal side effects and the patients were considered as candidates for implanted opioid delivery systems. However, when the epidural morphine was given in a double-blind and placebo-controlled manner, morphine did not produce greater analgesia than placebo and no dose-response relationship was seen. These cases show that careful investigation is necessary before proceeding to implanted systems and that changing the route did not improve the analgesia:side effect balance for morphine in these patients.",

Data were collected from 10 healthy volunteers during the use of one constant performance system and four variable performance systems at different gas flows and inspired oxygen fractions. A thin sampling catheter was placed in the nasopharynx to allow the measurement of the end-tidal oxygen fraction. When oxygen was supplied to variable performance systems, end-tidal oxygen fraction values measured in this way varied less and were more easily quantifiable than inspired oxygen fraction. End-tidal oxygen fraction was used to calculate inspired oxygen fraction. With the variable performance systems, inspired oxygen fraction varied considerably between subjects whereas a constant and equal rise was found for each subject with the fixed performance system. A large nasal catheter was capable of delivering the highest inspired oxygen fraction, whereas the Venturi mask delivered the most precise inspired oxygen fraction. We found oxygraphy useful in the interpretation of measurements made in patients receiving unknown inspired fractions of oxygen.",

Parents of 25 of these found the delivery system convenient and easy to use. While blinded to treatment it was assessed to be beneficial in nine of 13 receiving budesonide and four of 13 receiving placebo.

    "title": "Role of sodium in hemodialysis.",
    "abstract": "Sodium chloride is the most abundant salt in extracellular fluid. In normal individuals, the tonicity exerted by dissolved sodium chloride determines plasma osmolality and indirectly determines intracellular tonicity and cell volume. Uremic patients retain nitrogenous wastes and have an elevated plasma osmolality. While urea exhibits osmotic activity in serum, no sustained gradient can be established across cell boundaries because it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Thus, sodium remains the major indicator of body tonicity and determines the distribution of water across the intracellular-extracellular boundary, subsequent cell volume, thirst, and, among patients with renal insufficiency, systemic blood pressure. As a result of highly conserved plasma tonicity control systems, uremic subjects demonstrate remarkable stability of their serum sodium. Dialysate is a synthetic interstitial fluid capable of reconstituting extracellular fluid composition through urea extraction and extremely efficient solute and solvent (salt and water) transfer to the patient. Subtle transdialyzer gradients deliver and remove large quantities of trace elements, solvent, and solute to patients, creating a variety of dialysis \"disequilibrium\" syndromes manifest as cellular and systemic distress. Every dialysis patient uses dialysate, and the most abundant chemicals in dialysate are salt and water. Despite its universal use, no consensus on dialysate composition or tonicity exists. This can only be explained if we believe that dialysate composition is best determined by matching unique dialysis delivery system characteristics to specific patient requirements. Such a paradigm treats dialysate as a drug and the dialysis system as a delivery device. Understanding the therapeutic and toxic profiles of this drug (dialysate) and its delivery device (the dialyzer) is important to safe, effective, goal-directed modifications of therapy. This article explores some of the historical rationale behind choosing specific dialysate tonicities.",

The hemoglobin concentration and estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations were measured before and after treatment in both groups.RESULTS: Uterine volume decreased in the long-term treated group from 680+/-276 cm3 to 486+/-195 cm3 (36%) after two and to 388+/-172 cm3 (51%) after six LA injections. In the short-term treated group the basal uterine volume decreased from 745+/-320 cm3 to 456+/-177 cm3 (39%) after two LA injections. The uterine volume decrease was statistically significant (p<0.05) after two LA injections in both groups while the decrease observed between two and six LA injections was not significant (p>0.05). The intra-operative blood-loss was not significantly different between the two groups studied, 315+/-93 cm3 and 336+/-88 cm3.CONCLUSION: Two pre-operative GnRHa depot injections offer similar results, in terms of uterine shrinkage and intra-operative blood loss, and a longer treatment seems to be justified in cases of anemia.",

Beagles (n = 6) were randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups: namely, OSRMS 15 mg orally, NSRMS 15 mg orally, and 15 mg i.v. Serum samples were drawn at intervals up to 480 min following oral and 420 min following i.v. administration. Serum was analysed for morphine concentration using a radioimmunoassay. Data were analysed using non-compartmental pharmacokinetics. The only statistically significant difference between OSRMS and NSRMS was maximum serum concentration (Cmax). There were trends toward longer time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) and longer mean absorption time (MAT) for OSRMS when compared to NSRMS, but the differences were not statistically significant (P < 0.05). Pharmacokinetic parameters for both oral formulations exhibited large variability in the rate of absorption of MS from the gastrointestinal tract. Bioavailability of both OSRMS and NSRMS was low (15%-17%). As expected, the area under the concentration vs time curve (AUC) and Cmax for the i.v. data was significantly greater than for both oral groups, and Tmax and mean residence time (MRT) were significantly less following i.v. administration. There were no statistically significant differences among the 3 treatment groups for apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) or elimination parameters. The OSRMS formulation used in this study provided equivalent bioavailability to NSRMS in dogs, accompanied by large individual variability in drug absorption. It also did not appear that the sustained release formulation provided sufficiently prolonged release of morphine sulfate from the tablet matrix in dogs to allow prolonged dosing intervals compared to NSRMS.",

The mean morning PEF increased from 337 L x min-1 in the salmeterol group and 332 L x min-1 in the theophylline group to 372 and 357 L x min-1, respectively. No significant difference between the two treatments was observed for PEF, symptoms or additional salbutamol medication during the day. The incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms (gastric irritation, nausea and vomiting) was greater among patients receiving theophylline (11%) than with salmeterol (3%). These findings suggest that inhaled salmeterol is more effective in relieving symptoms of asthma, and better tolerated than theophylline in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma.",

No significant difference was observed between the groups in percent uterine volume reduction at each treatment week. Both groups showed significant and equal suppression of serum levels of E2, LH, and FSH. In addition, the incidence of adverse symptoms was not significantly different between the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: Monthly injection of 1.88 mg or 3.75 mg LA depot has equivalent treatment efficacy in reducing uterine volume. Twelve weeks of treatment is enough to obtain near maximal reduction.",

The patients in the cetrorelix group had a lower number of oocytes and embryos. The percentage of mature oocytes and fertilization rates were similar in both groups, and the pregnancy rates were not statistically different. The length of stimulation, number of hMG ampules administered, and occurrence of the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome were lower in the cetrorelix group.

    "abstract": "Respirable antisense oligonucleotides (RASONs), which attenuate specific disease-associated mRNAs, represent a new class of respiratory therapeutics with considerable potential. RASONs overcome previous obstacles that have impeded the development of antisense therapeutics targeting diseases in other organ systems. RASONs are delivered directly to the target tissue via inhalation; their uptake seems to be enhanced by cationic properties inherent in pulmonary surfactant, and, because of the markedly different target properties of mRNA and proteins, they can have very long durations of effect compared with traditional drugs targeting the protein of the same gene. RASONs contain chemical modifications that decrease their degradation by cellular nucleases. However, total insensitivity to nucleases is probably not an optimal design criterion for RASONs, because moderate nuclease sensitivity can prevent their systemic delivery, decreasing the potential for systemic toxicity. EPI-2010 is a 21-mer phosphorothioate RASON that attenuates bronchoconstriction, inflammation and surfactant depletion in preclinical models of human asthma, has a duration of effect of seven days, and seems to undergo minimal systemic delivery.",

Alkaline phosphatase, carboxypeptidases, beta-glucosidases and beta-lactamases among many others are being utilised to regenerate potent anti-cancer drugs or toxic small molecules from precursors in a bid to enhance their activity in tumours. These prodrug activation systems require the pretargeting of the enzyme to the surface of a tumour cell, usually by an antibody or its immunoreactive fragment. A recent novel approach proposes the intracellular delivery of appropriate enzymes, such as phosphodiesterases, to particular cellular compartments. There, enzyme activity can cause substantive damage resulting in cell death. Cell targeting of mammalian phosphodiesterase promises to improve upon conventional immunotoxins because of their increased cytotoxicity when targeted to the appropriate compartment and their expected lack of, or lower, immunogenicity in clinical use.",

A preferred set of pharmacokinetic parameters for propofol was selected using computer simulation of a known infusion scheme with pharmacokinetic parameters described in published literature. The selected model was included in a 'Diprifusor' module that was interfaced with, and later incorporated into, a computer-compatible infusion pump. Clinical trials with such systems led to guidance on appropriate target concentrations for the administration of propofol by 'Diprifusor' target controlled infusion for inclusion in drug prescribing information. Standardisation of the delivery performance (+/- 5%) of commercial systems has been achieved with a laboratory performance specification. Clinical studies indicate that the actual blood concentrations achieved were about 16% greater than the calculated values displayed by the system. In an individual patient, titration of the target concentration is required in the same manner as an anaesthetic vapouriser is adjusted to obtain a specific pharmacodynamic effect.",

According to recent reports, 2-3% of newborns have congenital malformations. These malformations are caused by interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Exposure of paternal or maternal organisms to environmental hazards may damage germ cells or interfere fetal development, resulting in malformation of various organ systems. Since environmental hazards exposures are complex, it is difficult to establish the primary effect of single factor. Factors, that are known to increase the risk of congenital malformations, preterm delivery or spontaneous abortion, are classified into five groups--psychological, social, biological, physical and chemical factors.

    "abstract": "AIM: To investigate deposition patterns and to assess the delivery rate of two nebuliser systems in children with cystic fibrosis (CF).METHODS: Thirty three children with CF on regular treatment with nebulised antibiotics had radioisotope scans performed using technetium-99m labelled aerosol antibiotic generated by a Ventstream nebuliser (median mass diameter (MMD), 3.3 microm; delivery rate, 0. 075 ml/min) under conditions similar to their routine home practice. The inhomogeneity of the images was scored on a 1-10 rating scale (a low score indicating even distribution of the antibiotic), and stomach deposition was measured as a percentage of overall deposition. Twenty patients had a repeat scan using an Optimist nebuliser (MMD, 1.8 microm; delivery rate, 0.02 ml/min).RESULTS: The mean inhomogeneity scores were 5.4 in the Ventstream group and 3. 5 in the Optimist group. Mean stomach deposition was 17.3% in the 33 patients using the Ventstream nebuliser. There was an inverse relation between height and stomach deposition (r = 0.69). In the 20 patients who had both nebulisers, the mean percentages of stomach deposition for the Ventstream and Optimist nebulisers were 11.8% and 1.6%, respectively. The Ventstream nebuliser delivered antibiotic at an average 2.8 times faster rate than the Optimist nebuliser.IMPLICATIONS: A smaller particle size results in a more homogenous distribution of the antibiotic in the lungs with decreased stomach deposition. This should not be seen as a recommendation to use the Optimist nebuliser because more antibiotic was delivered to most parts of the lung with the Ventstream because of its increased delivery rate.",

Assessment of lower leg growth rates with the knemometer has made short-term studies of growth processes under strictly controlled conditions possible. However, short-term lower leg growth rates cannot be used for estimations of intermediate-term height growth rates or long-term evaluations of final height. Consequently, the distinctions between the various types of growth studies in asthmatic children treated with inhaled glucocorticosteroids have become important and need to be discussed. The present paper presents a review of the long-, intermediate- and short-term growth studies available. The bulk of evidence from intermediate- and short-term evaluations indicates that growth rate is not affected when standard paediatric doses of inhaled glucocorticosteroids are used. However, further focus needs to be placed on differences between specific glucocorticosteroids, doses and delivery systems. Intermediate- and short-term growth data should be evaluated in the long-term perspective.",

    "title": "Antidepressants as analgesics: an overview of central and peripheral mechanisms of action.",
    "abstract": "Antidepressants, given systemically, are widely used for the treatment of various chronic and neuropathic pain conditions in humans. In animal studies, antidepressants exhibit analgesic properties in nociceptive, inflammatory and neuropathic test systems, with outcomes depending on the specific agent, the particular test, the route of administration and the treatment method used. Although early studies focused on central (i.e., supraspinal, spinal) actions, more recent studies have demonstrated a local peripheral analgesic effect of antidepressants. These peripheral actions raise the possibility that topical formulations of antidepressants may be a useful alternative drug delivery system for analgesia. Antidepressants exhibit a number of pharmacological actions: they block reuptake of noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine, have direct and indirect actions on opioid receptors, inhibit histamine, cholinergic, 5-hydroxytryptamine and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, inhibit ion channel activity, and block adenosine uptake. The involvement of these mechanisms in both central and peripheral analgesia produced by antidepressants is considered. Data illustrating the preclinical peripheral analgesic actions of antidepressants are presented, as are some aspects of the mechanisms by which these actions occur.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 10% of hospital in-patients in the UK acquire nosocomial infection, with an increasing number of these infections caused by multiresistant organisms. It is essential to halt the development and spread of antibiotic resistance among hospital pathogens. The relationship between antibiotic use and the development of antibiotic resistance in microorganisms is a subject of ongoing controversy and research. However, there is a general acceptance that control of antibiotic prescribing within hospitals is fundamental to controlling the development of nosocomial antibiotic resistance. In order to achieve this, there is a need to design and successfully implement targeted antibiotic policies based on local patterns of resistance. Traditional educational methods used alone for executing such policies have not been shown to be effective. Computer-based technology shows great promise but will require considerable resource allocation for its installation. Of equal importance, the Infection Control Team must be given a high profile. Robust surveillance systems to gather epidemiological data on local prescribing practices, hospital infection control policy compliance, antibiotic resistance and hospital infection rates need to be set up within individual hospitals. The appointment of an anti-infective pharmacist should be considered. Delivery of an integrated antibiotic and infection control service requires a co-ordinated, multidisciplinary team approach with clear leadership. Finally, in order for any strategy to be successful, the full support of hospital management is essential.",

Total duration of catheter use was 81 months (range, 1-62 weeks). Fifty-seven cycles of intraperitoneal therapy were administered through 18 catheters (range, 1-11). Nine catheters were removed without being used after patients randomized off intraperitoneal treatment arms or were ineligible for intraperitoneal protocols. There were no complications associated with catheter placement or removal. None of the catheters became obstructed or dislodged while in place. There were no cases of infectious peritonitis, although one patient developed an exit-site skin infection. Surgery is not required to remove the Groshong catheter which fosters empiric placement of the device at the time of laparotomy in all patients potentially eligible for intraperitoneal therapy. The device-related infection rate of 4.2 per 100 patients is similar to that described using other implanted devices. Catheter maintenance is easy and patient acceptance is good. The Groshong catheter is a safe, reliable, and acceptable means of delivering intraperitoneal therapy.",

    "abstract": "Midazolam is often used for paediatric premedication. We have compared two methods of administering midazolam intranasally in 44 surgical day-case children allocated randomly to receive midazolam 0.2 mg kg-1 as drops or midazolam 0.1 mg kg-1 from an intranasal spray device. Behaviour was recorded on a four-point scale by the parent, nurse and anaesthetist. Coefficients were obtained representing the change in behaviour score. There was no significant difference in method of administration (coefficient 0.13, P = 0.39). Children were significantly more distressed at the time of premedication and at the time of venous cannulation (coefficients 1.31 and 0.70) than at baseline. There was no significant difference in the assessments between observers. Midazolam by either method was equally effective but acceptability of the premedication was poor in both groups. Intranasal midazolam cannot be recommended as a method for routine premedication of young children.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease with a high morbidity and mortality from pulmonary disease. Sputum from CF patients contains high levels of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which contribute to its viscoelasticity. Recombinant deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) has been developed and in vitro studies have showed reduction in the viscoelasticity of CF sputum. This article reviews the in vivo clinical trials conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of this treatment. Phase 1 studies showed preliminary safety data and some evidence of clinical benefit. The two Phase 2 short-term studies showed improvement in pulmonary function and important safety data. The Phase 3 study, which included 968 patients, showed improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 5.8% and 5.6% in patients treated once and twice daily, respectively. The risk of developing an exacerbation of infection was reduced by 28% with once daily and 37% with twice daily treatment, compared to placebo. The drug was safe and there was some improvement in quality of life data. Longer-term open labelled studies, the results of intermittent administration, administration to severely ill patients, and the use of different delivery systems are reviewed. In conclusion, recombinant deoxyribonuclease is a new treatment which has been shown to benefit patients with cystic fibrosis when used in conjunction with conventional treatment.",

Surgery and chemotherapy have limited success in prolonging survival times and increasing quality of life in dogs with HSA. Advances in medical oncology are resulting in increased survival rates and a better quality of life for veterinary cancer patients. An understanding of mechanisms of metastasis has led to the development of new treatments designed to delay or inhibit tumor spread. Promising new treatment options include novel delivery systems (inhalation or intracavitary chemotherapy); use of immunomodulators such as liposome-encapsulated muramyl tripeptide-phosphatidylethanolamine; antimetastatic agents such as inhibitors of angiogenesis (interferons, thalidomide), matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, and minocycline; dietary modifications; and gene therapy. Inhibitors of angiogenesis seem to be safe and, unlike conventional chemotherapy, do not induce drug resistance. Although many of the newer approaches are still under development and review, the use of multimodality therapy incorporating innovative treatment modalities may offer the best therapeutic option for dogs affected with HSA.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of continuous nebulized (CN) albuterol therapy with those of intermittent nebulized (IN) albuterol therapy in the ED treatment of children with moderate to severe asthma exacerbations.METHODS: A prospective, randomized, single-blind study was conducted at a children's hospital ED. Patients aged 2 to 18 years with a moderate to severe asthma exacerbation (asthma score > or = 8) were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive either IN albuterol (0.15 mg/kg/dose every 30 min) or CN albuterol (0.3 mg/kg/hr) for a maximum of 2 hours. All patients received prednisone at entry. All released patients were evaluated by telephone, 48 hours after the ED visit. Estimates of respiratory therapist (RT) time commitments for the 2 delivery systems were calculated.RESULTS: There were 35 patients assigned to IN therapy and 35 to CN therapy. Nine of the 35 patients (26%) in the IN group and 8 of the 35 patients (22%) in the CN group were hospitalized (p = NS). Although the durations of ED therapy were comparable in the 2 groups, the time spent by the RTs in delivering asthma therapy was significantly less for the CN group than it was for the IN group (30.3 min vs 51.9 min per patient; p < 0.001). There was no major adverse effect in either study group.CONCLUSION: There was no difference in efficacy or safety between CN therapy and IN therapy in the ED management of moderate to severe asthma exacerbations in children. Moreover, CN therapy provided a significant time savings in the delivery of asthma therapy to patients in a busy ED.",

    "abstract": "Local skin reactions at the application site are the most common adverse events associated with the testosterone transdermal delivery (TTD) systems used to treat postpubertal hypogonadism in males. This open-label, controlled pilot study was conducted to determine whether topical pretreatment with triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream might be useful in reducing the incidence and/or severity of chronic skin irritation when used in healthy volunteers receiving TTD systems. Adult male volunteers wore three topical systems, which were applied to the upper back daily (Monday through Friday) for 6 weeks: (1) TTD with no pretreatment of application site; (2) TTD with pretreatment of application site using triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream; and (3) an inactive occlusive dressing (control). On Monday through Thursday, systems were removed 24 hours after application. Patches applied on Friday were worn continuously for 72 hours until their removal on Monday. Skin reactions were graded on a scale from 0 to 4 (0 = none, 4 = severe) and were assessed daily by research personnel, beginning at the time of system removal (assessment 1) and on the two subsequent clinic visits (assessments 2 and 3). All skin irritation scores of all subjects were totaled for each treatment regimen to obtain a cumulative score per treatment regimen. The cumulative scores were also analyzed by assessment time and study week (weeks 1-6). Eighty-two subjects were enrolled in the study, and 65 completed the 6-week treatment course. Mean age of subjects was 24 years (range, 18-69 years), and mean weight was 79.0 kg (range, 58.9-127.3 kg). All subjects were white males. At assessment 1, pretreatment with triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream (compared with no pretreatment) was associated more often with scores of 0 (no erythema), with comparable occurrences of mild skin irritation, and with fewer occurrences of moderate erythema. At all three assessments, more subjects had lower cumulative scores with pretreatment than without pretreatment. At every assessment and in each week of the study, total weekly cumulative skin irritation scores were also lower with pretreatment than without pretreatment. No adverse experiences other than skin irritation were reported. Results of this study suggest that in patients using TTD systems, the incidence and severity of skin irritation at application sites may be reduced through pretreatment with triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream.",

    "title": "Pulmonary deposition of nebulised amiloride in cystic fibrosis: comparison of two nebulisers.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Preliminary evidence suggests that regular inhalation of nebulised amiloride reduces sputum viscoelasticity, increases the clearance of sputum by mucociliary mechanisms and by coughing and reduces the rate of deterioration in lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis. These effects depend on adequate delivery of amiloride to the airways. This study was performed to quantify and compare pulmonary deposition of amiloride produced by two different nebuliser systems. METHODS The pulmonary deposition of nebulised amiloride (1 mg in 3 ml saline) was measured in eight patients with cystic fibrosis when given via a jet (System 22 with CR 60 compressor) and an ultrasonic (Fisoneb) nebuliser. Human serum albumin labelled with technectium-99m was used as an indirect marker for amiloride and its deposition in the lung was detected with a gamma camera. RESULTS Amiloride inhalation caused no side effects or changes in spirometric indices. The mean (SD) total pulmonary amiloride deposition was 57 (24) micrograms with the System 22 and 103 (53) micrograms with the Fisoneb nebuliser. Pulmonary deposition was completed more rapidly with the Fisoneb (4-5 minutes) than with the System 22 nebuliser (7-8 minutes) and the Fisoneb was preferred by the patients. CONCLUSIONS Both nebulisers appeared to deliver adequate amounts of amiloride to the lungs, but treatment with the Fisoneb nebuliser was quicker, more efficient, and more acceptable to the patients. Of the two nebulisers assessed, the Fisoneb would be preferred for clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "A new approach to cancer drug discovery targets molecules important in cancer pathogenesis. This approach is thought to be of greater promise than the antiproliferative screens which discovered cytotoxic agents and dominated cancer drug discovery for 60 years. However, one cannot lose sight of the fact that these targets exist in the cellular environment consisting of many additional influences on target function, and that effective drug treatment will take into account drug uptake, metabolism and elimination at the level of the cell as well as the organism. A key goal is to define for the new millennium a path to cancer drug discovery and development which accounts for the cancer cell phenotype in its totality rather than as arising solely from single molecular targets. The US National Cancer Institute maintains a cell-based drug discovery screen which can define a context for drug action in the milieu of more than 300 molecular targets and thousands of gene expression patterns which have been measured in the 60 human tumour cell lines which comprise the screening panel. The challenge of the millennium will be addressed by molecules active against defined targets but with selectivity of action occurring in the milieu of deregulated cancer cell biology in all its aspects.Copyright 2000 Cancer Research Campaign.",

    "abstract": "Xenon anaesthesia is thought to have minimal haemodynamic side-effects. It is, however, expensive and requires special delivery systems for economic use. In this randomised cross-over study, we: (i) investigated the haemodynamic profile and recovery characteristics of xenon compared with propofol sedation in postoperative cardiac surgery patients, and (ii) evaluated a fully closed breathing system to minimise xenon consumption. We demonstrated a significantly faster recovery from xenon (3 min 11 s) than propofol sedation (25 min 23 s). Relative to propofol, xenon sedation produced no change in heart rate or mean arterial pressure and there were significantly higher mean values for central venous pressure (10.6 vs. 8.9 mmHg), pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (11.2 vs. 9.5 mmHg), mean pulmonary artery pressure (20.1 vs. 18.3 mmHg) and systemic vascular resistance index (2170 vs. 1896 dyn.s.cm-5.m-2). The haemodynamic profile seen with propofol reflected its known vasodilator effects.

    "title": "Mechanisms regulating angiotensin II responsiveness by the uteroplacental circulation.",
    "abstract": "Pregnancy is associated with increases in cardiac output and uterine blood flow (UBF) and a fall in systemic vascular resistance. In ovine pregnancy, UBF rises from approximately 3% of cardiac output to approximately 25% at term gestation, reflecting a >30-fold rise in UBF by term. This increase in UBF supports exponential fetal growth during the last trimester and maintains fetal well-being by providing excess oxygen and nutrient delivery. These hemodynamic changes are associated with numerous hormonal changes, including increases in placental steroid hormones and enhanced activation of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems, all of which are believed to modulate systemic and uterine vascular adaptation and vascular reactivity. Systemic pressor responses to infused ANG II are attenuated in normotensive pregnancies and the uteroplacental vasculature is even less sensitive, suggesting development of mechanisms to maintain basal UBF and permit the rise in UBF necessary for fetal growth and well-being. The effects of ANG II on the uteroplacental vasculature are reviewed, and the mechanisms that may account for attenuated vascular sensitivity are examined, including ANG II metabolism, vascular production of antagonists, ANG II-receptor subtype expression, and the role of indirect mechanisms.",

This review describes the current state of knowledge of genetic variability in key airway targets important in the treatment of asthma. Whilst the genes coding for some key treatment targets contain little polymorphic variation (e.g. the muscarinic M2 and M3 receptors) other genes whose products are important targets in the treatment of asthma contain extensive genetic variation. The best examples of the latter are the beta2-adrenoceptor and the 5-lipoxygenase genes. Genetic variability in both of these genes may account in part for interindividual variability in treatment response. Finally, a number of key targets within the airways remain to be adequately screened for polymorphic variation.",

    "abstract": "In 20 patients with established coronary artery disease, stable angina pectoris and reproducible ST-segment depression, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of 60 mg slow-release isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) (10 patients) after a 7-day therapy were compared with those of a placebo group (10 patients) using a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study design. Ten patients could be controlled after long-term therapy over a mean of 399 +/- 111 days. There was no significant change under IS-5-MN of either blood pressure, heart rate, rate-pressure product, or myocardial oxygen consumption. Treatment over one week significantly reduced ST-segment depression 4 and 8 h after drug intake (38-48% of the placebo value, p less than 0.01). Maximum reduction in ST-segment depression was found 4 and 8 h after IS-5-MN intake both after one-week and long-term therapy at the time of peak plasma drug concentration (341 +/- 95 and 405 +/- 125 ng/ml, respectively). At a residual plasma concentration below 100 ng/ml, ST depression was not significantly improved 24 h after drug intake compared with placebo. Technetium-99m ventriculography showed an insignificant increase in ejection fraction and a slight reduction of ventricular volumes after both short- and long-term therapy with IS-5-MN (p greater than 0.05). The drug's plasma levels were higher under chronic than under short-term therapy which may be due to enzyme saturation. Maximum IS-5-MN plasma concentrations at a mean of 445 +/- 116 ng/ml were reached after 5.8 +/- 2.9 h. Beta-phase half-life of elimination was 9 +/- 3 h. IS-5-MN administered as a single 60 mg dose of a slow-release preparation/day proved to have a favorable pharmacokinetic profile as well as an efficient antiischemic activity after both short- and long-term therapy. Problems of tolerance or activation of hormonal counter-regulation due to vasodilation were not observed.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the present study we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of i.m. octreotide acetate (octreotide LAR) in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) previously treated and failed on i.m. lanreotide.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients (8 females, 7 males, median age 67 years, range 28-81 years) with metastatic NETs (8 endocrine pancreatic tumors, 7 midgut carcinoids) were enrolled in the study. All patients were in progressive disease (objective: 11 patients, symptomatic: 10 patients, biochemical: 11 patients) after treatment with slow release lanreotide, 30 mg every 14 days for a median time of 8 months (range 3-19 months). All patients had measurable disease; 12 patients had elevated serum and/or urine markers and 11 were symptomatic. Octreotide scintigraphy was positive in 13 of 15 patients. Octreotide LAR was administered as i.m. injection at the dose of 20 mg every four weeks until disease progression.RESULTS: An objective partial response (PR) was documented in one patient (7%), no change (NC) in six (40%), and progressive disease (PD) in eight patients (53%). The PR was observed in one patient with non-functioning endocrine pancreatic tumor with progressive liver and lymph node metastases after 16 months of i.m. lanreotide therapy. The median duration of disease stabilization was 7.5 months (range 6-12+ months). The overall biochemical response rate was 41%, including CRs (33%) and PRs (8%); biochemical responses were observed in carcinoids as well as in endocrine pancreatic tumors; the median duration of response was 5 months for CRs and 7.5 months for PRs. The overall symptomatic response rate was 82%. The median duration of response for diarrhoea, abdominal pain, or both was 6.5 months (range 3-12+ months). Improvement in performance status (PS) was obtained in 5 of 11 patients with PS of 1 at study entry. Median duration of octreotide LAR treatment was seven months (range 3-12+ months). No serious adverse events were reported; mild side effects were reported in 26% of patients.CONCLUSIONS: Octreotide LAR 20 mg shows significant efficacy in terms of objective response rate (PR + SD), biochemical and symptomatic control in patients with metastatic NETs of the GEP system pretreated and progressing on slow release lanreotide.",

    "abstract": "In a double blind, crossover study of the response of autistic subjects to fenfluramine, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 7 subjects on an attention-demanding auditory choice reaction time task (ACRT). ACRT, IQ and biochemical measures were taken after 5 months placebo and 5 months fenfluramine treatment. After fenfluramine treatment blood serotonin levels fell, urinary catecholamine levels fell and the HVA/DA ratio rose. IQ and ACRT performance improved. On the ACRT subjects were asked to press a button to a rare target (500 Hz, P = 0.14) and to ignore higher pitched rare (2,000 Hz, P = 0.14) and frequent non-targets (1,000 Hz). After fenfluramine treatment N1 latencies increased. The scalp distribution of ERP maxima changes slightly with treatment. P3 maxima elicited by rare non-targets were recorded more rostrally after fenfluramine treatment. After rare non-targets N1 amplitudes at Fz decreased but P3 amplitudes at Pz increased. Early negativity after the rare non-target (particularly on the right side) was negatively correlated with the HVA/DA ratio. Subtraction of the P3 component elicited in a passive condition where no response was required from the active condition showed that P3 positivity to targets was halved with treatment. (In contrast Nd increased on fenfluramine treatment). Overall, N1 and P3 components showed greatest responsiveness to rare non-targets on fenfluramine. N1 but not P3 changes may represent slight improvement of attention-related function with treatment. Small changes in ERP latency and distribution, associated with the neuroleptic action of fenfluramine may be partly responsible for a mild improvement of IQ and ACRT performance on medication.",

    "title": "Gene expression regulation by retinoic acid.",
    "abstract": "Over the last quarter century, more than 532 genes have been put forward as regulatory targets of retinoic acid. In some cases this control is direct, driven by a liganded heterodimer of retinoid receptors bound to a DNA response element; in others, it is indirect, reflecting the actions of intermediate transcription factors, non-classical associations of receptors with other proteins, or even more distant mechanisms. Given the broad range of scientific questions continually under investigation, researchers do not always have occasion to classify target genes along these lines. However, our understanding of the genetic role of retinoids will be enhanced if such a distinction can be made for each regulated gene. We have therefore evaluated published data from 1,191 papers covering 532 genes and have classified these genes into four categories according to the degree to which an hypothesis of direct versus indirect control is supported overall. We found 27 genes that are unquestionably direct targets of the classical pathway in permissive cellular contexts (Category 3 genes), plus 105 genes that appear to be candidates, pending the results of specific additional experiments (Category 2). Data on another 267 targets are not evocative of direct or indirect regulation either way, although control by retinoic acid through some mechanism is clear (Category 1). Most of the remaining 133 targets seem to be regulated indirectly, usually through a transcriptional intermediary, in the contexts studied so far (Category 0).",

    "title": "The global epidemiology of HIV/AIDS.",
    "abstract": "In this paper, the ways in which HIV is transmitted and factors facilitating transmission are described, although we still do not fully understand why the HIV epidemic has spread so heterogeneously across the globe. Estimates of HIV prevalence vary in quality but give some idea of trends in different countries and regions. Of all regions in the world, sub-Saharan Africa is the hardest hit by HIV, containing around 70% of people living with HIV/AIDS. There are, however, recent signs of hope in Africa due to a slight reduction in the number of new HIV cases in the year 2000. Most countries in Asia have not seen explosive epidemics in the general population up to now but patterns of injecting drug use (IDU) and sex work are conducive to the spread of HIV so there is no room for complacency. Unpredictable epidemics among IDU in the former Soviet Union have the potential to spread into the general population. Some countries in Central America and the Caribbean have growing HIV epidemics with adult prevalences second only to sub-Saharan Africa. Reductions in morbidity and mortality through the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy are at present limited to high-income and some Latin American countries. Both the cost of these therapies and the poor health care delivery systems in many affected countries need to be addressed before antiretrovirals can benefit the majority of people living with HIV/AIDS.",

The concept of a vulnerable parameter as a factor contributing to arrhythmogenesis, amenable to modulation by drugs or other interventions, has helped conceptualize the targeted approach to both drug discovery and drug selection. Moreover, broadening our perspectives to include both the triggers of and substrates for arrhythmias widens the scope of promising targets for drug development programs.",

Thirty-two adult asthmatics (21 males and 11 females with a mean age of 34 years) who demonstrated at least 15% reversibility in PEF or FEV1 in response to terbutaline, were enrolled for study. The median reversibility in FEV1 was 27.5% for the terbutaline-salbutamol group and 21% for the salbutamol-turbutaline group. Two patients discontinued during terbutaline treatment (one due to respiratory infection and one due to tachycardia, exhaustion and tremor) and five patients were lost to follow-up during salbutamol treatment, leaving data from 25 patients for an 'all patients treated' analysis. Mean morning PEF was 426 l min-1 during terbutaline and 410 l min-1 during salbutamol (difference 16 l min-1, 95% CI of difference 3-28 l min-1, P = 0.016), and mean evening PEF was 446 l min-1 during terbutaline and 428 l min-1 during salbutamol (difference 18 l min-1, 95% CI 5-30 l min-1, P = 0.0076). No significant differences were detected in diary symptom scores or in use of additional study drug during the day or night, and no serious adverse events were reported. When asked to state their treatment preferences on the basis of effects, side-effects and overall, more patients preferred Turbuhaler in each case, although no statistically significant differences were detected. In conclusion, terbutaline via Turbuhaler was significantly more effective than salbutamol via Rotahaler in controlling lung function (mean daily PEF) in adults with mild to moderate asthma, and it was the preferred treatment overall in 44% of patients, compared with 16% for Rotahaler (n.s.).",

    "title": "Potassium channels: how genetic studies of epileptic syndromes open paths to new therapeutic targets and drugs.",
    "abstract": "How can epilepsy gene hunting lead to better care for patients with epilepsy? Lessons may be learned from the progress made by identifying the mutated genes that cause Benign Familial Neonatal Convulsions (BFNC). In 1998, a decade of clinical and laboratory-based genetics work resulted in the cloning of the KCNQ2 potassium channel gene at the BFNC locus on chromosome 20. Subsequently, computer \"mining\" of public DNA databases allowed the rapid identification of three more brain KCNQ genes. Mutations in each of these additional genes were implicated as causes of human hereditary diseases: epilepsy (KCNQ3), deafness (KCNQ4), and, possibly, retinal degeneration (KCNQ5). Physiologists discovered that the KCNQ genes encoded subunits of the \"M-channel,\" a type of potassium channel known to control repetitive neuronal discharges. Finally, pharmacologists discovered that retigabine, a novel anticonvulsant with a broad but distinctive efficacy profile in animal studies, was a potent KCNQ channel opener. These studies suggest that KCNQ channels may be an important new class of targets for anticonvulsant therapies. The efficacy of retigabine is currently being tested in multicenter clinical trials; identification of its molecular targets will allow it to be more efficiently exploited as a \"lead compound.\" Cloned human KCNQ channels can now be expressed in cultured cells for \"high-throughput\" screening of drug candidates. Ongoing studies of the KCNQ channels in humans and animal models will refine our understanding of how M-channels control excitability at the cellular, network, and behavioral levels, and may reveal additional targets for therapeutic manipulation.",

    "title": "New central mediators as targets of centrally acting antihypertensive drugs.",
    "abstract": "The modulation of peripheral sympathetic activity by the central nervous system may involve various pathways, neurotransmitters and receptors. In particular central catecholaminergic neurones and alpha-adrenoceptors have been analysed in detail, and they are recognized as important targets of the classic centrally acting antihypertensives clonidine, guanfacine and alpha-methyl-DOPA. Initially these drugs have been assumed to reduce elevated blood pressure via the stimulation of central alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the brain stem, thus leading to peripheral sympathoinhibition and a reduction of elevated blood pressure, heart rate and plasma catecholamines. In a later stage it has been recognized that central imidazoline (I1) receptors, probably located in the nucleus reticularis lateralis in the medullary region may also be involved in the central regulation of peripheral sympathetic activity, and for that matter as a target of centrally acting antihypertensives. Moxonidine and rilmenidine are the prototypes of such agents. Accordingly, the receptor profile of the various types of centrally acting antihypertensives may be characterized as follows: [formula: see text] The various compounds mentioned will thus cause peripheral sympathoinhibition, initiated by different receptor targets in the CNS. Finally, the peripheral alpha 1-blocker urapidil has been demonstrated to possess an additional central mechanism, mediated by the stimulation of serotonergic 5HT1A-receptors located in the rostral ventrolateral medulla.",

    "title": "Interstitial lung disease induced by exogenous agents: factors governing susceptibility.",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to describe the present state of knowledge regarding host susceptibility factors that may determine the occurrence, development and severity of interstitial lung disease (ILD) caused by exogenous agents. First, host susceptibility may pertain to differences in the delivery and/or persistence of the noxious agent in the lung. The deposition and clearance of inhaled particles or fibres may vary depending on innate anatomical or physiological characteristics, and on acquired changes, such as nasal disease or smoking-induced alterations. Genetically- or environmentally-induced interindividual differences in the expression of pulmonary biotransformation enzymes may form the basis for, or contribute to the risk of, drug-induced interstitial lung disease. Secondly, there are genetic and acquired variations in various enzymatic and nonenzymatic defence systems that protect cells and tissues against oxidative stress, which is often involved in the pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease caused by particles, fibres, metals, organic agents and drugs. Thirdly, the occurrence of immunological sensitization is dependent on both genetic and environmental factors. This has been demonstrated in chronic beryllium lung disease and in hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Fourthly, the propensity of individuals to develop particular types of inflammation, such as granulomas, is probably under genetic control. The regulation and resolution of inflammation and fibrogenesis caused by dust particles are also partly determined by genetic factors, involving cytokine networks and growth factors. In conclusion, although the issue of genetics pervades the entire discussion of host susceptibility, genes are not the only determinants of health and disease. Environmental factors may be equally important in shaping host susceptibility. Therefore, research must be focused on both the genetic bases and the environmental determinants of interstitial lung disease, in order to provide mechanism-based prevention strategies, early detection of, and improved therapy for these conditions.",

It is only ten years since the first chemokine receptor was discovered, and the rapidly expanding number of antagonists holds promise for new medicines to combat diseases that are currently incurable. Here, I focus on the rationale for developing antagonists of chemokine receptors for inflammatory disorders and AIDS, and the accumulating evidence that favours this strategy despite the apparent redundancy in the chemokine system.",

Ten HLA-B7-negative patients with stage IV melanoma were treated in an effort to stimulate local tumor immunity. Plasmid DNA was detected within treated tumor nodules, and RNA encoding recombinant HLA-B7 or HLA-B7 protein was demonstrated in 9 of 10 patients. T cell migration into treated lesions was observed and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte reactivity was enhanced in six of seven and two of two patients analyzed, respectively. In contrast, the frequency of cytotoxic T lymphocyte against autologous tumor in circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes was not altered significantly, suggesting that peripheral blood lymphocyte reactivity is not indicative of local tumor responsiveness. Local inhibition of tumor growth was detected after gene transfer in two patients, one of whom showed a partial remission. This patient subsequently received treatment with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes derived from gene-modified tumor, with a complete regression of residual disease. Thus, gene transfer with DNA-liposome complexes encoding an allogeneic major histocompatibility complex protein stimulated local antitumor immune responses that facilitated the generation of effector cells for immunotherapy of cancer.",

    "abstract": "The clinical effects of CV 205-502, a potent and non-ergot-derived dopamine agonist, were investigated in 24 selected patients with hyperprolactinemia previously treated with standard oral bromocriptine, the slow-release oral form of bromocriptine (BRC-SRO) and/or the long-acting injectable form of bromocriptine (BRC-LAR); 14 were chosen because of their resistance to treatment and ten because they were intolerant of the different forms of bromocriptine. A macroprolactinoma was present in seven patients and a microprolactinoma in ten, whereas seven had no radiological images of a pituitary tumor and were classified as having non-tumoral hyperprolactinemia. All the 24 patients were treated with CV 205-502 at a daily dose of 0.075-0.6 mg for 3-12 months. All the patients had gonadal dysfunction and galactorrhea. Basal serum prolactin values ranged from 70 to 1677 ng/ml. CV 205-502 was effective in 11 of the 14 patients resistant bromocriptine, BRC-SRO and BRC-LAR; serum prolactin levels became normal within 6 months and a tumor shrinkage was obtained in five of the seven macroprolactinomas. In general, the drug was effective and well tolerated. Only three patients (two resistant and one intolerant) manifested nausea, vomiting and postural hypotension. In conclusion, this study shows that CV 205-502 is effective in bromocriptine-resistant hyperprolactinemic patients. Furthermore, CV 205-502 has insignificant and tolerable side-effects in patients intolerant of bromocriptine. CV 205-502 can, therefore, be considered a useful and effective drug, and an interesting therapeutic alternative to the ergot-derived dopamine-agonist drugs in use today.",

    "title": "Mechanisms of general anesthesia.",
    "abstract": "Although general anesthetics are often said to be nonspecific agents, it is likely that they act at a much more restricted set of target sites than commonly believed. The traditional view has been that the primary targets are lipid portions of nerve membranes, but recent evidence shows that the effects on lipid bilayers of clinically relevant levels of anesthetics are very small. Effects on most proteins are also small, but there are notable examples of proteins that are extremely sensitive to anesthetics and mimic the pharmacological profile of anesthetic target sites in animals. Such target sites are amphiphilic in nature, having both hydrophobic and polar components. The polar components appear to behave as good hydrogen-bond acceptors but poor hydrogen-bond donors. Although the targets can accept molecules with a wide variety of shapes and chemical groupings, they are unaffected by molecules exceeding a certain size. Overall, the data can be explained by supposing that the primary target sites underlying general anesthesia are amphiphilic pockets of circumscribed dimensions on particularly sensitive proteins in the central nervous system.",

Among potential targets for new modes of chemotherapy are malarial proteases, which appear to mediate processes within the erythrocytic malarial life cycle, including the rupture and invasion of infected erythrocytes and the degradation of hemoglobin by trophozoites. Cysteine and aspartic protease inhibitors are now under study as potential antimalarials.

The clinical development of target-based anticancer drugs will require fundamental changes to the traditional clinical trial design and end points that have been used for conventional cytotoxic drugs. In the phase I and II settings, traditional end points (toxicity and response) may not be suitable for more selective, cytostatic target-based agents, and these end points may be replaced by biological or pharmacokinetic end points to define the optimal doses and the therapeutic effects of these drugs on their targets. For phase III trials, measurable clinical benefit will continue to be the primary end point. As our understanding of the complex pathways and networks controlling cell signaling, proliferation, and cell death expands, we must learn how and when to use agents to target specific steps in malignant transformation and proliferation, and we must adapt clinical trial design to test the clinical utility of this promising new class of anticancer drugs.",

Advances in molecular neurobiology have identified specific molecular targets (subunits of ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, and transporters) and have made them available in a form permitting high-throughput screening. AEDs can be designed to interact with specific sites on the target molecules. Alternatively, the molecular screens can be used to identify active components in natural products, including folk remedies. Preclinical in vivo screens can be improved by using animals with genetic or acquired epilepsies that have similar modifications in the properties of the target molecules as do human epilepsy syndromes.

This phenomenon was also demonstrated in chicken embryos and a human CD4(+) T cell line, H9. The in vivo transduction of beta-catenin D-RNAi was shown to knock out more than 99% endogenous beta-catenin gene expression, while the in cell transfection of HIV-1 D-RNAi homolog rejected viral gene replication completely. D-RNAi was found to have long-term gene knockout effects resulting from a posttranscriptional gene silencing mechanism that may involve the homologous recombination between intracellular mRNA and the mRNA components of a D-RNAi construct.

    "title": "Perspectives for the treatment of infections with Flaviviridae.",
    "abstract": "The family Flaviviridae contains three genera: Hepacivirus, Flavivirus, and Pestivirus. Worldwide, more than 170 million people are chronically infected with Hepatitis C virus and are at risk of developing cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. In addition, infections with arthropod-borne flaviviruses (such as dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis, West Nile, and yellow fever viruses) are emerging throughout the world. The pestiviruses have a serious impact on livestock. Unfortunately, no specific antiviral therapy is available for the treatment or the prevention of infections with members of the Flaviviridae. Ongoing research has identified possible targets for inhibition, including binding of the virus to the cell, uptake of the virus into the cell, the internal ribosome entry site of hepaciviruses and pestiviruses, the capping mechanism of flaviviruses, the viral proteases, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and the viral helicase. In light of recent developments, the prevalence of infections caused by these viruses, the disease spectrum, and the impact of infections, different strategies that could be pursued to specifically inhibit viral targets and animal models that are available to study the pathogenesis and antiviral strategies are reviewed.",

    "abstract": "The major problem facing world research for new antimalarials lies in encountered difficulties in the search for new promising paths. The past 20 years have witnessed a very impressive increase in our understanding of the biochemistry and molecular biology of malaria parasites, with attention focused on specific parasite molecules that are keys to the parasite life cycle or the induction of its pathogenesis. Directed pharmacology research has involved the identification and characterization of targets that can be specifically pharmacologically affected, including the replicating machinery of the parasites, various metabolisms such as the purine salvage pathway, and biosynthesis of pyrimidines or phospholipids. Protease inhibitors (e.g. those degrading haemoglobin), the use of iron chelators or inhibition of heme polymerization, induction of oxidative stress or inhibition of antioxidant enzymes are also investigated. Some pathways have already been validated with current antimalarials but, due to the development of resistance, complete characterization of the molecular structure of the target should allow attack of these exceptional molecules at novel and distinct sites with new drug concepts. The problem in the quest to develop new antimalarials is the fact that the results are not being materialized, but there is no lack of pharmacological targets.",

    "abstract": "Arsenic trioxide (As2O3; ATO) has considerable efficacy in the treatment of relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), inducing partial differentiation and promoting apoptosis of malignant promyelocytes. Although initial studies focused on the role of the characteristic APL fusion protein, PML-RARalpha, in mediating response to ATO, subsequent investigations have revealed that ATO acts on numerous intracellular targets. ATO broadly affects signal transduction pathways and causes a wide range of alterations leading to apoptosis. Key mediators of sensitivity to ATO-induced apoptosis include intracellular glutathione and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The loss of inner mitochondrial membrane potential is also an important step in ATO-mediated cell killing. Cellular and physiologic pathways affected by ATO provide some clues as to the mechanisms for the biologic effects of ATO. Recent research has shown that hematologic cancers other than APL and solid tumors derived from several tissue types may be responsive to monotherapy or combination therapy with ATO. A better understanding of the mechanisms of action of ATO may help guide the use of ATO for the treatment of a wide variety of malignancies and allow its potential in cancer therapy to be fully realized.",

The primary objectives of the study were to examine the impact of this treatment course on the UFT targets which are thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). The rate of tumoral TS inhibition after the 7-day UFT treatment sequence varied from 5% up to 31%. UFT treatment induced a constant and variable decrease in tumor DPD activity ranging from 13% to 60%. UFT treatment induced a constant increase in uracil concentrations both in plasma and tumors. FT, 5-FU and the metabolite fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL) were found in plasma and tumors at variable concentrations; the highest drug concentrations were those of FBAL in plasma. The present translational clinical study provides data related to the in vivo pharmacological effects of UFT with a description of its impact on cellular targets.",

The mechanisms of adenosine-induced bronchoconstriction appear to involve a selective interaction with activated mast cells with subsequent release of preformed and newly-formed mediators. Further evidence linking adenosine signalling to asthma and COPD comes from the finding that many cell types that play important roles in the exacerbation of these conditions express adenosine receptors and demonstrate relevant effects through stimulation of these receptors. Therefore, blockade of these receptors may be a valuable approach to the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Promising adenosine-receptor targets for novel therapeutics of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have recently been identified in a number of inflammatory cell types, including mast cells, eosinophils, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages. The recent characterisation of the A2B receptors indicates the human lung mast cell as one of the most strategic cellular targets.",

    "title": "The nature of sites of general anaesthetic action.",
    "abstract": "The molecular nature of the site of general anaesthesia has long been sought through the process of comparing the in vivo potencies of general anaesthetics with their physical properties, particularly their ability to dissolve in solvents of various polarities. This approach has led to the conclusion that the site of general anaesthesia is largely apolar but contains a strong polar component. However, there is growing evidence that several physiological targets underlie general anaesthesia, and that different agents may act selectively on subsets of these targets. Consequently research now focuses on the details of general-anaesthetic-protein interactions. There are large amounts of structural data that identify cavities where anaesthetics bind on soluble proteins that are readily crystallizable. These proteins serve as models, having no role in anaesthesia. Two problems make studies of the more likely targets--excitable membrane proteins--difficult. One is that they rarely crystallize and the other is that the sites have their highest affinity for general anaesthetics when the channels are in the open state. Such states rarely exist for more than tens of milliseconds. Crystallographers are making progress with the first problem, whilst anaesthesia researchers have developed a number of strategies for addressing the second. Some of these (kinetic analysis, site-directed mutagenesis) provide indirect evidence for sites and their nature, whilst others seek direct identification of sites by employing newly developed general anaesthetics that are photoaffinity labels. Such studies on acetylcholine, glycine and GABA receptors point to the existence of sites located within the plane of the membrane either within the ion channel lumen (acetylcholine receptor), or on the outer side of the alpha-helix lining that lumen (GABAA and glycine receptors). Bound anaesthetics generally exert their actions on ion channels by binding to allosteric sites whose topology varies from one conformation to another, but definitive proof for this mechanism remains elusive.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) is considered an important signaling molecule implied in various different physiological processes, including nervous transmission, vascular regulation, and immune defence, as well as the pathogenesis of several diseases. NO reportedly also has an antiviral effect on several DNA and RNA virus families. The NO-mediated S-nitrosylation of viral and host (macro)molecules appears to be an intriguing general mechanism for the control of the virus life cycle. In this respect, NO is able to nitrosylate cysteine-containing enzymes (e.g., proteases, reverse transcriptase, and ribonucleotide reductase). Moreover, zinc-fingers and related domains present in enzymes (e.g., HIV-1-encoded integrase or herpes simplex virus type-1 heterotrimeric helicase-primase complex) or nucleocapsid proteins may be considered as NO targets. Also, NO may regulate both host (e.g., nuclear factor-kappaB) and viral-encoded (e.g., HIV-1 tat protein or Epstein-Barr virus Zta) transcriptional factors that are involved in virus replication. Finally, NO-mediated S-nitrosylation of cysteine-containing glycoproteins and hemagglutinin may also occur. Here, NO targets are summarised, and the molecular bases for the antiviral effect of NO are discussed.",

As such there is an urgent need for new ways of thinking about anti-HIV drug development, and accordingly novel viral and cellular targets critical to HIV-1 replication need to be explored and exploited. The retroviral RNA genome encodes for three enzymes essential for viral replication: HIV-1 protease (PR), HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and HIV-1 integrase (IN). The enzymatic functioning of each of these enzymes is entirely dependent on their oligomeric structures, suggesting that inhibition of subunit-subunit assembly or modulation of their quaternary structures provide alternative targets for HIV-1 inhibition. This review discusses the recent advances in the design and/or identification of synthetic peptides and small molecules that specifically target the subunit-subunit interfaces of these retroviral enzymes, resulting in the inactivation of their enzymatic functioning.",

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) provide a valuable tool for this pharmacogenetic approach to cancer therapy. The discovery of SNPs as disease markers may facilitate identification of populations at increased risk for certain cancers. In addition, SNP genetic screening may facilitate administration of appropriate treatment modalities or reveal specific genetic profiles that have importance in drug efficacy and toxicity. In addition to SNP analysis, DNA and tissue microarray analyses have the potential to transform the future of cancer therapy. For example, DNA microarrays may improve tumor classification systems as well as provide a molecular level dissection of global gene expression changes that occur in carcinogenesis. Tissue microarrays would allow one to verify candidate genes, identified from DNA microarrays, against archival tumor specimens with known clinical outcome. In addition, both microarray technologies may be combined to rapidly validate gene targets. We will review and discuss these state-of-the-art technologies including data suggesting that the combined use of these high throughput technologies will facilitate our understanding of the genetic complexities inherent in cancer and will revolutionize cancer therapy.",

Critical to initiation is the new phenotype in the initiated cell, known only in one instance, the rat liver, in which the characteristic change is one of resistance to many xenobiotic influences. The need for clonal expansion of initiated cells as essential for carcinogenic effects is discussed. Differential inhibition has been shown as a dominant mechanistic pattern in the liver. In other systems, the manner in which clonal expansion is achieved is not evident.

    "title": "[Effect of antihypertensive combinations on arterial pressure, albuminuria, and glycemic control in patients with type II diabetic nephropathy: a randomized study].",
    "abstract": "Type II diabetic patients with albuminuria are at high risk for cardiovascular complications; the intense antihypertensive treatment required often involves using drug combinations. The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of two different, renin-angiotensin blocking combinations, on blood pressure (BP), albuminuria and glycemic control. Its design was prospective, randomised, controlled, of parallel branches, and performed in one Endocrinology Department, in Spain. 77 type-II diabetic patients, with stable albuminuria (30-1,000 mg/day) were included. After a pre-inclusion time of 2 weeks, patients were randomised to verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 (VT) or losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (LH) 20/12.5 mg/day. Duration of treatment was 1 year. The evaluated parameters were changes in blood pressure, urinary albumin excretion for 24 hours, glycated hemoglobin and plasmatic urea. Overall BP significantly decreased from 161.6 +/- 18.7/83.6 +/- 10.2 mmHg to 137.2 +/- 15.7/70.9 +/- 8.3 mmHg (p < 0.0005). Values, by treatment, were: For VT, 164.3 +/- 18.5/87.2 +/- 10.7 mmHg at baseline and 135.0 +/- 15.1/71.3 +/- 8.4 mmHg at conclusion. For LH, 158.8 +/- 17.4/80.1 +/- 8.4 mmHg at baseline and 139.3 +/- 16.1/70.5 +/- 8.2 mmHg at conclusion. Albuminuria significantly decreased from 308.2 +/- 544.7 mg/day to 198.0 +/- 285.3 mg/day. Both parameters showed no significant difference between treatments. Glycated hemoglobin decreased from 7.59 +/- 1.3% to 7.14 +/- 1.2% in the VT group, and from 7.96 +/- 1.29% to 7.84 +/- 1.62% in the LH group (ANOVA, p = 0.022). Changes adjusted from baseline values showed a trend to the difference between both treatments (p = 0.092). Plasmatic urea increased from 39.8 +/- 12.7 to 40.5 +/- 11.1 mg/dL in the TV group and from 43.4 +/- 12.0 mg/dL to 52.4 +/- 19.4 mg/dL in the LH group (ANOVA, p = 0.028). In conclusion, both treatments reduce blood pressure and albuminuria in a similar way in type II diabetic patients. The verapamil/trandolapril combination contributes to a better carbohydrate metabolism than losartan/hydroclorothiazide.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of high blood pressure (BP) reduces the risk of death and morbidity from stroke and coronary heart disease. There is accumulating evidence from large outcome studies that support a move towards lower treatment targets in hypertensives, particularly for those with concomitant risk factors or evidence of established target organ damage. At present, the achieved rates for BP control in the UK are very poor. Amongst the many possible reasons for poor BP control is the under utilisation of effective drug combinations. This article addresses the rationale for two and three drug combination therapy in hypertension and reviews the trial evidence for efficacy of combinations.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) appears to play a role in modulating cardiac function in both health and disease. Early studies in isolated rodent cardiac myocytes demonstrated a depressant effect of NO supplied by NO donors (exogenous) as well as NO generated within myocytes (endogenous). There is increasing evidence for a functional NO generating system within the human myocardium, which appears upregulated in certain disease states. Induction of the high output nitric oxide synthase isoform (iNOS) has been demonstrated in the failing myocardium, though its functional significance remains unproven. More recently published data have contradicted the notion that NO acts solely as a negative inotrope demonstrating positive inotropy in both isolated rodent and human ventricular myocytes in response to a range of NO donors. Different NO donors have different NO release kinetics and generate a range of NO species (NO., NO+ and NO-) which may interact at a number of subcellular targets. The observed response of any cardiac preparation to an NO donor represents the net effect of activation of different effector targets and may explain the contradictory reported effects of NO. To realise the therapeutic potential of NO will require specific targeting at a subcellular level.",

    "abstract": "An increasing body of evidence demonstrates that lithium and valproate have a regulatory effect on signal transduction pathways. Alteration of signalling molecules triggers changes in gene expression which are thought to contribute to the therapeutic effects of these drugs on bipolar disorder. Differential-display PCR was used to identify genes in rat cerebral cortex that are regulated by chronic treatment with lithium and valproate. One novel lithium-regulated gene was identified and was characterized and studied further with 5'-RACE-PCR and library screening. We also found that valproate regulated the expression of the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78). Chronic treatment with valproate has also been found to increase gene transcription, mRNA and protein levels of GRP78. These results suggest novel targets for lithium and valproate that may be relevant to their mechanism of action. The data further our understanding of the mechanism of the action of mood stabilizers, and help identify new targets for genetic studies and therapeutic strategies in bipolar disorder.",

For bacterial vaccine discovery, one can \"mine\" the genomic sequence for potential surface targets using various algorithms, characterize these gene targets, and produce primers for cloning, all before one enters the wet laboratory. This review will focus on various genomic mining tools/algorithms available for predicting open reading frames and their associated annotation (if known), physical and functional characterization, and cellular localization.

Imprinted genes are necessary for normal mammalian development. This requirement has been proposed to have evolved because of an interparental genetic battle for the utilization of maternal resources during gestation and postnatally. The nonrandom requisite for monoallelic expression of a subset of genes has also resulted in the formation of susceptibility loci for neurobehavioral disorders, developmental disorders, and cancer. Since imprinting involves both cytosine methylation within CpG islands and changes in chromatin structure, imprinted genes are potential targets for dysregulation by epigenetic toxicants that modify DNA methylation and histone acetylation.",

These effects include increased incidence of hormone-dependent cancers, compromised reproductive fitness, and abnormal reproductive system development. In response to public concern, regulatory agencies in North America and Europe are formulating potential strategies to systematically test chemicals and complex mixtures for their endocrine-disrupting activities. Because of the complexity of the endocrine system and the number of potential endocrine disruptor targets, a tiered approach involving a complementary battery of short- and long-term in vivo and in vitro assays that assesses both receptor and nonreceptor-mediated mechanisms of action is being considered. However, the available established assays use a limited number of end points, and significant information gaps exist for other potential targets in the endocrine system. In addition to discussing the merits and limitations of the assays that may be adopted, this paper also highlights potential problems associated with the use of a tiered testing strategy.",

    "title": "Current strategies for anticancer chemoprevention and chemoprotection.",
    "abstract": "Relatively new targets in drug design projects in cancer pharmacology include cytostatic agents, immune system modulators, and angiogenesis inhibitors. Preventive oncology applies pharmacological agents to reverse, retard, or halt progression of neoplastic cells to invasive malignancy. Prevention of cancer, however, can be accomplished through many strategies, including changes in diet and lifestyle. For example, the vast majority of lung cancers (80-90%) can be attributed to cigarette smoking and therefore, the most effective primary preventive strategy for lung cancer is to quit smoking. Chemoprevention through interruption of multistage careinogenesis include different molecular targets. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) act as estrogen receptor (ER) agonists. Ligands for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) suppress breast carcinogenesis in experimental models and induce differentiation of human liposarcoma cells. Selective PPAR modulators (SPARMs), by analogy to the SERM concept, are designed to have desired effects on specific genes relevant to carcinogenesis. Enzymatic approach in endocrine-related tumors involve inhibition of aromatase to prevent breast cancer and inhibition of 5-alpha-reductase to prevent prostate cancer. Down-regulation of inflammatory prostaglandin synthesis by inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). inhibition of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and stimulation of phase II detoxication system, are currently examined in experimental models and clinical trials. Overall, potential targets in preventive strategies to reduce the risk of cancer involve agonists of endocrine receptors, factors down-regulating inflammation, factors inducing programmed cell death (PCD)/apoptosis, enzymatic inhibitors and gene therapy.",

Forty-six patients were randomized into two groups. At each visit, capillary blood was taken for the POCT monitor and venous blood for the laboratory coagulometer. In Group 1, for 6 months, dosage was based on the CoaguChek and for the second 6 months on the coagulometer. In the second group, the order was reversed. Dosages were determined using the dawn ac computer programme. Success was assessed by the percentage of time patients were maintained within the INR targets. Agreement between laboratory and monitor INR, and patient satisfaction were also assessed. Results with the POCT monitor compared well with the hospital coagulometer. Time in INR target range between the groups was similar, with 60.9% on the POCT monitor and 59.3% with the laboratory coagulometer in Group 1 and in Group 2, respectively, 64.3% and 63.4% with no significant difference in mean INR. An INR above 4.0 gave some discrepant results. International Sensitivity Index calibrations of the two test systems indicated that the INRs were dependable. Patient questionnaires showed greater satisfaction with community POCT monitoring.",

Till date the antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) including the Class I and the pure Class III agents have not been recommended for controlling malignant ventricular arrhythmias in a diseased heart, not because of low efficacy but because of an increase in mortality due to their toxic effects. A vulnerable substrate (VS) possessing some properties such as reduced NE and SOD activity, hypertrophied myocardium, and an increase in QT dispersion, is reported to develop in non-infarcted zone of an infarcted heart. Hypertrophied ventricle and exaggerated cardiac arrhythmia can be produced on chronic medication with levothyroxin and this model shares some properties of VS. There is a significant difference in the pattern of disordered ion channels between the congenital long QT syndrome(LQTS) and the acquired heart disease. The affected ion channel in congenital LQTS is single. A novel mutation causing an early appearance of stop codon was discovered in HERG gene resultant with a single disarranged IKr channel leading to a prolonged QT interval. In contrast it is characterised with multi-channels and non-specific disorder in the hypertrophied myocardium in the acquired heart disease. The disordered ion channel is the consequence of the VS lesion influencing the lipid membrane in a diseased heart. The VS and multiple ion channel disorder are provided as new targets to treat cardiac arrhythmias in a diseased heart.",

Large-scale randomized trials can provide only a partial guide and have not been or cannot be carried out for most clinical disorders. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in individual patients (N of 1 RCTs) may in some circumstances provide a solution to this dilemma. In an N of 1 RCT a patient undergoes pairs of treatment periods (one period of each pair with the active drug and one with matched placebo, assigned at random); both the patient and the clinician are blind to allocation, and treatment targets are monitored. N of 1 RCTs are useful for chronic, stable conditions for which the proposed treatment, which has a rapid onset of action and ceases to act soon after it is discontinued, has shown promise in an open trial of therapy. The monitoring of treatment targets usually includes quantitative measurement of the patient's symptoms with the use of simple patient diaries or questionnaires. Pairs of treatment periods are continued until effectiveness is proved or refuted. The cooperation of a pharmacy is required for the preparation of matching placebos and conduct of the trial. Formal statistical analysis may be helpful for interpreting the results. The practical approach presented in this paper allows clinicians to conduct their own N of 1 RCTs.",

    "title": "The mechanism of action of cyclosporin A and FK506.",
    "abstract": "The immunosuppressants cyclosporin A (CsA), FK506, and rapamycin suppress the immune response by inhibiting evolutionary conserved signal transduction pathways. CsA, FK506, and rapamycin bind to their intracellular receptors, immunophilins, creating composite surfaces that block the activity of specific targets. For CsA/cyclophilin and FK506/FKBP the target is calcineurin. Because of the large surface area of interaction of the drug-immunophilin complex with calcineurin, FK506 and CsA have a specificity for their biologic targets that is equivalent to growth factor-receptor interactions. To date, all the therapeutic as well as toxic effects of these drugs have been shown to be due to inhibition of calcineurin. Inhibition of the action of calcineurin results in a complete block in the translocation of the cytosolic component of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), resulting in a failure to activate the genes regulated by the NF-AT transcription factor. These genes include those required for B-cell help such as interleukin (IL-4) and CD40 ligand as well as those necessary for T-cell proliferation such as IL-2. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the means by which these drugs produce immunosuppression.",

Examples include internal ribosome entry sites in some viral mRNAs and ribosomal frameshifting during production of retroviral proteins. Viruses often inhibit host translation and/or possess mechanisms leading to preferential synthesis of viral proteins. In addition, a participant in the cellular antiviral response is the enzyme PKR (protein kinase, RNA activated), which is involved in the control of cellular translation. Thus, viruses and host cells wage war on the battlefield of translation. The distinctive features of protein synthesis in virally infected cells provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

    "title": "Signal transduction in inflammatory processes, current and future therapeutic targets: a mini review.",
    "abstract": "The selective control of inflammatory reactions will continue to be a major issue in the development of new drugs. Many new molecular targets are coming up. This paper highlights a few key mediators that are nowadays considered as interesting therapeutic intervention points. Cytokines play an important regulatory role in the initiation, maintenance and termination of inflammatory reactions. More than 50 cytokines have been identified, and more and more has become known about their receptors and signal transduction pathways. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is still regarded as one of the initial cytokines of the cascade, and different approaches are followed to control its synthesis, release or effects. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a one of the triggers that is able to induce a strong TNF-response. Inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs), including rolipram and pentoxifylline suppress the LPS-induced TNF-alpha production in monocytes/macrophages. In our laboratory it has been shown that the alternative way to increase cAMP levels, via stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors, also provides an effective way, both in vitro and in vivo, to inhibit TNF-alpha release. Other therapeutic ways include the use of antibodies directed to cytokines, TNF receptor fused to IgG, antibody therapy against TNF, the use of MAP kinase inhibitors. The different signal transduction pathways, including the NF-kappa B activation route may provide alternative pharmacological tools. We may surely expect anti-inflammatory drugs of much greater specificity to be developed in the next decade. Despite the relative limited investments in veterinary drug development this will also have consequences for veterinary therapy.",

Horizontal gene transfer in bacteria is favored by the presence of mobile genetic elements and by the organization of bacterial genomes into operons allowing for the cooperative transfer of genes with related functions. The selective pressure for the spread of resistance genes correlates strongly with the clinical and agricultural overuse of antibiotics. The future of antimicrobial chemotherapy may lie in developing new antimicrobials using information from comparative functional microbial genomics to find genetic targets for antimicrobials and also to understand gene expression enabling selective targeting of genes with expression that correlates with the infectious process.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophils are uniquely endowed with an arsenal of enzymes that enable them to generate an array of reactive oxidants and diffusible radical species. The formidable arsenal at their disposal likely evolved because of the central role these phagocytes play in combating invading helminths and other large metazoan pathogens. Although these leukocytes constitute an essential component of the effector limb of host defenses, they also are implicated in contributing to inflammatory tissue injury. The growing prevalence and severity of asthma, a respiratory disease characterized by recruitment and activation of eosinophils in the airways of affected individuals, has focused research efforts on elaborating the many potential mechanisms through which eosinophils may contribute to tissue injury and oxidative modification of biological targets in asthma. Eosinophil activation is strongly suspected as playing a contributory role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Accordingly, an understanding of the basic chemical pathways available to the leukocytes for generating specific reactive oxidants and diffusible radical species in vivo is required. In the following review, recent progress in the elaboration of specific mechanisms through which eosinophils generate oxidants and other reactive species are discussed. The potential contributions of these intermediates to modification of biological targets during asthma are described. Particular emphasis is placed upon the secreted hemoprotein eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), a central participant in generation of reactive oxidants and diffusible radical species by the phagocytes.",

This was a single-center, open-label, three-treatment study conducted in 24 male and female healthy volunteers. The mean age was 40.6 yr (SD = +/- 12.27). A three treatment design was chosen to compare differences between modes of administration within each subject to minimize the impact of intersubject variability: Treatment A was a continuous 48-hr subcutaneous infusion of morphine sulfate (165.6 mg at a rate of 3. 45 mg/hr) with the MEDIPAD system attached to the chest, Treatment B was a series of four oral doses of morphine sulfate (120 mg each) at 12-hr intervals, and Treatment C was a continuous 48-hr subcutaneous infusion of morphine sulfate (163.2 mg at a rate of 3.40 mg/hr) with the CADD-Micro device attached to the chest. Subjects began treatment after eligibility was established and informed consent was obtained. The primary pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, C(max)) for the two devices were similar; 90% confidence intervals showed that the MEDIPAD system was bioequivalent to the CADD-Micro in terms of both rate and extent of morphine absorption. The mean morphine plasma concentration versus time plot suggested that plasma concentrations rise more rapidly with the MEDIPAD device than with the CADD-Micro or oral administrations. The MEDIPAD system showed mild application and injection site reactions; there were no site reactions for the CADD-Micro or oral doses. As expected nausea, somnolence, and abdominal pain occurred more frequently in the oral treatment than the two infusion devices. These data suggest that the MEDIPAD system, which is currently undergoing clinical evaluation, is an acceptable alternative to the traditional oral treatment of morphine sulfate for delivery of analgesics as it allows rapid absorption of morphine; is small, easy to use, and disposable; and achieves plasma levels that are essentially equal to other standard infusion pumps.",

    "abstract": "An exciting new approach to the treatment of cancer is the development of therapeutic strategies which target growth factors and the signal transduction pathways elicited by them. The rationale for targeting the processes which regulate cell proliferation rests on the contention that the malignant phenotype is maintained as a result of alterations in the biochemistry of growth control. The challenge is to design novel anticancer agents which exploit qualitative or quantitative differences in the biochemical elements controlling tumour cell growth and thereby achieve tumour selectivity. A wide variety of drugs are currently under development and include agents which block growth factor-receptor interaction, or which inhibit the action or formation of second messengers such as protein kinase C or phospholipase C. Although in its infancy, the use of inhibitors of growth factor action as antineoplastic agents has already proven effective against some tumours.",

    "title": "Potassium channel openers as potential therapeutic weapons in ion channel disease.",
    "abstract": "The opening of potassium (K+) channels, causing hyperpolarization of the cell membrane, is a physiological means of decreasing cell excitability. Thus, drugs with this property will demonstrate a broad clinical potential. The identification of synthetic molecules that evoke physiological responses (for example smooth muscle relaxation) by the opening of K+ channels led to a new direction in the pharmacology of ion channels. The term \"potassium channel openers\" was initially associated with a group of chemically diverse agents (for example, cromakalim, pinacidil, nicorandil) that evoke K+ efflux through adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ channels (KATP). This finding initiated a search to identify molecules that specifically open other K+ channel subtypes (for example large conductance calcium-activated K+ channels [BKCa]). K+ channel opening properties have been demonstrated in a diverse range of synthetic chemical structures and endogenous substances. Second generation KATP channel openers (KATPCOs) demonstrate heterogeneous pharmacology indicative of independent sites of action for the different agents. Successful cloning of the KATP channel has shed light on the heterogeneity of the structure targeted by KATPCOs. Expression of the actions of KATPCOs involves three isoforms of the sulfonylurea (SUR) receptor (which forms the beta subunit of the KATP channel). The distribution of the SUR isoforms (and potential of identifying new isoforms) provides unique targets for the development of selective KATPCOs giving focused therapeutic approaches to clinical conditions for example cardiac ischemia, urinary incontinence, neurodegeneration, obesity and autoimmune diseases. BKCa channels are found in a diverse array of tissues and due to voltage and Ca sensitivity may work as a negative feedback process. A variety of small synthetic molecules (for example, NS004, fenamates) and natural product-derived compounds (DHS-I, maxikdiol) have been identified as selective BKCa channel openers which should have a profound impact in controlling diseases. The discovery of numerous variants of the alpha subunit (ion conductance pore) and beta subunit (contributes biophysical and pharmacological properties) complex of the BKCa channel gives potential to target specific tissues with selective openers. Little is known, however, about the site(s) of interaction of openers of these channels. The discovery of K+ channel subtype-specific openers and their evaluation in different diseases will determine the degree to which these channels (KATP, BKCa), or their isoforms, represent realistic therapeutic targets. Drugs already marketed that open K+ channels were discovered empirically, and most have serious safety and efficacy problems. New scientific methods, utilizing molecular insight, are implicating K+ channel dysfunction in numerous disease states and are identifying new targets for the future generation of K+ channel opening drugs.",

The dimensional approach to clinical psychopharmacology views the behavioral targets of psychotropes as phenomena existing on a continuum and as components, in varying degrees, of most psychopathologies. The modern concept of dimension has been used in different contexts. In psychology it has a mathematical sense, whereas in biological psychiatry it is associated more with biological function. This paper reviews these two concepts and the recent models attempting to merge them into one. The heuristic value of the dimensional approach, as well as some of its pitfalls and new avenues of research, are discussed.",

The ECM components in fibrotic liver are similar regardless of the underlying cause. Activation of hepatic stellate cells is the central event in hepatic fibrosis. These perisinusoidal cells orchestrate an array of changes including degradation of the normal ECM of liver, deposition of scar molecules, vascular and organ contraction, and release of cytokines. Not only is hepatic fibrosis reversible, but it is also increasingly clear that cirrhosis may be reversible as well. The exact stage at which fibrosis/cirrhosis becomes truly irreversible is not known. Antifibrotic therapies will soon be a clinical reality. Emerging therapies will be targeted to those patients with reversible disease. The paradigm of stellate cell activation provides an important framework for defining therapeutic targets.",

Considerable efforts in trying to create potential drug candidates has led to the parturition of combinatorial chemical libraries.

The alpha(2) adrenoceptor antagonist clonidine, as well as somatostatin, oxytocin, and possibly amitriptyline have also been shown to act as visceral analgesics.

The intracellular concentrations of these cyclic nucleotides are regulated by a superfamily of phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes which break down cAMP and cGMP and, thereby, affect airway tone and inflammation. Theophylline and other drugs that act through inhibition of PDE are currently the subject of great research interest, since the uncovering of their anti-inflammatory actions suggests a possible additional mode of action in inflammatory diseases such as asthma. The characterisation of multiple families of PDE isoenzymes with distinct tissue distributions has encouraged hope that selective PDE inhibitors can be developed which act at specific targets without exhibiting the side effects of non-selective inhibitors like theophylline. The combination of bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory properties in a single drug by selective inhibition of specific PDE isoenzymes could produce agents most efficacious in every way for asthma therapy.",

New oral medications make these targets easier to achieve, especially in patients with recently diagnosed diabetes. Acarbose, metformin, miglitol, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone and troglitazone help the patient's own insulin control glucose levels and allow early treatment with little risk of hypoglycemia. Two new long-acting sulfonylureas (glimepiride and extended-release glipizide) and a short-acting sulfonylurea-like agent (repaglinide) simply and reliably augment the patient's insulin supply. Combinations of agents have additive therapeutic effects and can restore glucose control when a single agent is no longer successful. Oral therapy for early type 2 diabetes can be relatively inexpensive, and evidence of its cost-effectiveness is accumulating.",

Despite increasing awareness of this metabolic syndrome, the etiology of these side effects remains obscure. This review critically examines current mechanistic hypotheses in the context of the available experimental data. To date, a single unifying explanation for this syndrome has not been confirmed. As data accumulate, it is becoming clear that PIs lack precision in their cellular targets and it is likely that many of the side effects of these drugs are due to inhibition of a number of unrelated molecules.",

    "abstract": "Airway hyper-reactivity is a characteristic feature of many inflammatory lung diseases and is defined as an exaggerated degree of airway narrowing. Chemokines and their receptors are involved in several pathological processes that are believed to contribute to airway hyper-responsiveness, including recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells, collagen deposition and airway wall remodeling. These proteins are therefore thought to represent important therapeutic targets in the treatment of airway hyper-responsiveness. This review highlights the processes thought to be involved in airway hyper-responsiveness in allergic asthma, and the role of chemokines in these processes. Overall, the application of chemokines to the prevention or treatment of airway hyper-reactivity has tremendous potential.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO), derived from L-arginine (L-Arg) by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is involved in the regulation of several important physiological and pathophysiological functions. The mechanisms by which NO exerts some of its beneficial or detrimental effects include activation of guanylate cyclase, formation of peroxynitrite, apoptosis, and regulation of cyclooxygenase (COX). Cyclooxygenase (COX) is the enzyme that converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins (PG), prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane A2. The role of NO in the regulation of COX and its importance in physiology, pathology and therapy will be reviewed. Evidence will be presented to suggest that COX enzymes are targets for the physiopathological roles of NO and that once activated in the presence of NO, they represent important transduction mechanisms for its multifaceted actions.",

Direct exposure of various cell types of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide or lipid hydroperoxides can directly induce apoptosis, while in many experimental models pretreatment of cells with antioxidants has been shown to protect against this form of cell death. Recent experimental evidence suggests that multiple forms of thymocyte apoptosis can be inhibited by free radical spin traps, spin probes and thiol reductants, and that this inhibition correlates with a lower oxidative burden within the treated cells. Possible sites of production of these oxidants include mitochondrial electron transport and phospholipase A2-activated arachidonic acid metabolism, while intracellular targets may include redox sensitive transcription factors and inhibitory proteins that must be tagged for proteolysis before apoptosis can commence.",

The contribution of adaptive evolution is evident from examples of rapidly evolving genes, which represent the likely targets for strong selection.

Adaptive changes in the population are accomplished through selective sweeps, i.e. complete or partial fixation of beneficial alleles. The evidence is accumulating that selective sweeps are quite frequent events which, together with associated genetic hitchhiking, represent dominant forces that influence molecular evolution by shaping the variability pattern in the genome.",

An inspection of the early and more recent literature shows that several targets at the cellular level have been identified. Since their effects on the nuclear signalling pathway have already been well-defined and extensively reviewed, this article focuses on the regulation of mitochondrial activity by thyroid hormones. Mitochondria, by virtue of their biochemical functions, are a natural candidate as a direct target for the calorigenic effects of thyroid hormones. To judge from results coming from various laboratories, it is quite conceivable that mitochondrial activities are regulated both directly and indirectly. Not only triiodo-L-thyronine, but also diiodothyronines are active in regulating the energy metabolism. They influence the resting metabolism in rats with 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine seeming to show a clearer effect.",

Release of endocannabinoids is stimulated in a receptor-dependent manner by neurotransmitters and requires the enzymatic cleavage of phospholipid precursors present in the membranes of neurons and other cells. Once released, the endocannabinoids activate cannabinoid receptors on nearby cells and are rapidly inactivated by transport and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. These compounds might act near their site of synthesis to serve a variety of regulatory functions, some of which are now beginning to be understood. Recent advances in the biochemistry and pharmacology of the endocannabinoid system in relation to the opportunities that this system offers for the development of novel therapeutic agents will be discussed.",

    "title": "New approaches to the treatment of myelodysplasia.",
    "abstract": "The therapeutic dilemma that confronts the management of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is illustrated by the absence of a Food and Drug Administration-approved agent with an indication for this disease. Clinical heterogeneity and inadequate understanding of the disease pathobiology have limited progress in the development of novel therapeutics. Preclinical investigations indicate that reciprocal interaction between the malignant clone and the microenvironment serve to create a hostile milieu that reinforces ineffective blood cell production. Ineffective hematopoiesis, the hallmark of MDS, arises from impaired progenitor responsiveness to normal trophic signals and excess local generation of inhibitory cytokines, which promote accelerated apoptotic loss of progenitors and their progeny. Evidence to support this model derives from cytokine neutralization studies and the direct relationship between plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentration and DNA oxidation and glutathione depletion in malignant CD34+ progenitors. Recent investigations indicate that angiogenic molecules generated by malignant myelomonocytic precursors represent integral diffusable signals that reinforce leukemia progenitor self-renewal while promoting the generation of proapoptotic cytokines and medullary angiogenic response. The potential for leukemia evolution is compounded by epigenetic events including methylation silencing of the p15 proto-oncogene or activating ras point mutations. Delineation of such biologic features that are central to the pathobiology of MDS provides a reliable framework for the development of novel therapeutics. Antiangiogenic agents in clinical testing include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, thalidomide and related analogues, and the recombinant VEGF neutralizing antibody, bevacizumab. Agents whose actions may restore differentiation programs, such as the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors or histone deacetylase inhibitors, offer the prospect to promote effective hematopoiesis while impacting the potential for leukemia evolution. RAS farnesyl transferase inhibitors have shown encouraging preliminary results in acute myeloid leukemia and are currently under investigation in advanced MDS and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) interacts with a spectrum of biologic targets that may be uniquely suited to MDS. ATO is a potent inducer of apoptosis in thiol-depleted malignant progenitors and neovascular endothelium, while promoting differentiation through histone acetylation and inactivation of transcriptional corepressors. The identification of relevant biologic targets in MDS has raised expectations for the development of disease-specific therapies for MDS in the years that follow.",

The results (AUC units +/- s.e.m., control versus cancer) show that mononuclear cells from patients with adenocarcinoma mediate ADCC as efficiently as those from controls for m17-1A (143 +/- 14 vs 153 +/- 14), c17-1A (174 +/- 16 vs 189 +/- 14) cSF25 (215 +/- 18 vs 237 +/- 13) and effectors and targets alone (57 +/- 9 vs 51 +/- 8). Both chimeric antibodies mediated ADCC more effectively than m17-1A with cSF25 consistently producing the highest lysis. Furthermore, more efficient ADCC was found to correspond with monocyte activation examined flow cytometrically. The results (mean channel fluorescence) show that HLA-DR expression is increased with c17-1A (1436 +/- 200) and cSF25 (2252 +/- 298) above that observed when effectors and targets were incubated alone (1157 +/- 168) or with m17-1A (1286 +/- 170). Similarly, interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) expression (percentage of positive cells) was augmented in the presence of m17-1A (15 +/- 3), c17-1A (14 +/- 3) and cSF25 (25 +/- 3) when compared with no antibody (9 +/- 2). We discuss the possibility that the superior ADCC activity of chimeric antibodies, especially cSF25, may be due to increased monocyte activation.",

    "abstract": "In recent years intense activity in both academic and industrial sectors has provided a wealth of information on the human genome with an associated impressive increase in the number of novel gene sequences deposited in sequence data repositories and patent applications. This genomic industrial revolution has transformed the way in which drug target discovery is now approached. In this article we discuss how various differential gene expression (DGE) technologies are being utilized for cardiovascular disease (CVD) drug target discovery. Other approaches such as sequencing cDNA from cardiovascular derived tissues and cells coupled with bioinformatic sequence analysis are used with the aim of identifying novel gene sequences that may be exploited towards target discovery. Additional leverage from gene sequence information is obtained through identification of polymorphisms that may confer disease susceptibility and/or affect drug responsiveness. Pharmacogenomic studies are described wherein gene expression-based techniques are used to evaluate drug response and/or efficacy. Industrial-scale genomics supports and addresses not only novel target gene discovery but also the burgeoning issues in pharmaceutical and clinical cardiovascular medicine relative to polymorphic gene responses.",

    "abstract": "GLUCOCORTICOIDS are potent inhibitors of inflammatory processes and are widely used in the treatment of asthma. The anti-inflammatory effects are mediated either by direct binding of the glucocorticoid/glucocorticoid receptor complex to glucocorticoid responsive elements in the promoter region of genes, or by an interaction of this complex with other transcription factors, in particular activating protein-1 or nuclear factor-kappaB. Glucocorticoids inhibit many inflammation-associated molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, arachidonic acid metabolites, and adhesion molecules. In contrast, anti-inflammatory mediators often are up-regulated by glucocorticoids. In vivo studies have shown that treatment of asthmatic patients with inhaled glucocorticoids inhibits the bronchial inflammation and simultaneously improves their lung function. In this review, our current knowledge of the mechanism of action of glucocorticoids and their anti-inflammatory potential in asthma is described. Since bronchial epithelial cells may be important targets for glucocorticoid therapy in asthma, the effects of glucocorticoids on epithelial expressed inflammatory genes will be emphasized.",

As yet immune-based therapies have had little if any impact. However it is clear that eradication of HIV is not achievable with existing anti-HIV drugs and in spite of the major advances there remain many challenges in the clinical management of HIV-infected individuals. These benefits are unlikely to be extended to resource poor countries in the foreseeable future. The barriers are primarily but not only the costs. In resource-rich countries there are concerns about long term toxicities and many people have already exhausted all of the current therapeutic options. There is an urgent need for new drugs, ideally attacking new targets or with no cross resistance to existing drugs, and which are well tolerated and safe, easy to take and cheap.

Are these targets achievable? Antiretroviral monotherapy during pregnancy, delivery, and the neonatal period can reduce the rate of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 by two-thirds in non-breastfeeding populations. Shorter and simpler regimens of monotherapy have been associated with a reduction of 50% in such transmission among non-breastfeeding populations and of up to 40% in breastfeeding populations. Delivery by elective caesarean section is associated with a halving of the risk of mother-to-child transmission. However, breastfeeding poses a substantial additional risk of acquisition of HIV, and if prolonged it more than doubles the overall rate of transmission. Rates below 2% are being reported from settings where combination therapy is applied during pregnancy and delivery, delivery is by elective caesarean section, and breastfeeding does not take place. In breastfeeding populations where elective caesarean delivery is not an option but peripartum antiretroviral therapy is used, rates at six weeks are about 10% but can be 25% or more after 18 months of breastfeeding. More widely applicable interventions are being developed, such as cleansing of the birth canal and antiretroviral therapy during the breastfeeding period.",

    "abstract": "Contrary to previous expectations, innate resistance to a primary schistosome infection is mediated predominantly in the lungs of many laboratory rodents. In addition, the phenomenon of non-permissiveness seen in a sub population of 129 strain mice, is associated with worm relocation from the liver to the lungs and is facilitated by dramatic alteration to the lung and liver vasculature; lung located adult worms exhibit gut damage and are ultimately destroyed within eosinophil-rich inflammatory focal reactions. It is now clear that the immunity induced by exposure to radiation-attenuated cercariae can be affected in the skin (mice), the lungs (mice and rats) or the liver (guinea pigs) of laboratory rodents. Moreover, the fact that skin phase resistances involves radio-sensitive cells, while lung and liver phase immunity centres on radio-resistant leucocytes, resolves current discord in the literature. Immobilisation and trapping of challenge larvae within focal inflammatory infiltrates is nevertheless common to both skin and lung phase attrition. Hyperimmunisation of rodents with irradiated cercariae is associated with a switch in immunoglobulin isotype and serum harvested from such donors is able to protect naive recipients passively; transferred serum recruits effector cells. Challenge parasites exhibit a broader window of sensitivity to vaccine immunity than was originally envisaged; stages ranging from the 3 to 4 day old skin/lung stage larva to the 3 week old juvenile liver worm constitute targets of protective resistance in vivo. This is at variance with the fact that newly transformed schistosomula constituting the primary targets of in vitro effector mechanisms, a feature perhaps related to our inability to mimic the process of intravascular parasite immobilisation and trapping in the test tube. Finally, schistosomicidal drugs such as Praziquantel can, by re-exposing disguised parasite antigens, facilitate the expression of vaccine immunity in sites additional to those at which resistance is normally mediated.",

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors. PPARs play an important role in the general transcriptional control of numerous cellular processes, including lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, cell cycle progression, cell differentiation, inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling. Three PPAR isoforms, designated PPARalpha, PPARbeta and PPARgamma, have been cloned and are differentially expressed in several tissues including the kidney. PPARalpha primary regulates lipid metabolism and modulates inflammation. PPARalpha is the molecular target of the hypolipidemic fibrates including bezafibrate and clofibrate. PPARbeta participates in embryonic development, implantation and bone formation. PPARgamma is a key factor in adipogenesis and also plays an important role in insulin sensitivity, cell cycle regulation and cell differentiation. Antidiabetic thiazolidinediones (TZDs) such as troglitazone and rosiglitazone are specific ligands of PPARgamma, and this interaction is responsible for the insulin-sensitizing and hypoglycemic effect of these drugs. The kidney has been shown to differentially express all PPAR isoforms. PPARalpha is predominantly expressed in proximal tubules and medullary thick ascending limbs, while PPARgamma is expressed in medullary collecting ducts, pelvic urothelium and glomerular mesangial cells. PPARbeta is ubiquitously expressed at low levels in all segments of nephron. Accumulating data has begun to emerge suggesting physiological and pathophysiological roles of PPARs in several tissues including the kidney. The availability of PPAR-selective agonists and antagonists may provide a new approach to modulate the renal response to diseases including glomerulonephritis, glomerulosclerosis and diabetic nephropathy.",

Information gained from one class of antimicrobial agents has often been used to advance the development of other classes. In the case of beta-lactams, information on structure-activity relationships gleaned from penicillins and cephalosporins was rapidly applied to the cephamycins, monobactams, penems, and carbapenems in order to discover broad-spectrum agents with markedly improved potency. These efforts have led to the introduction of many new antibiotics that demonstrate outstanding clinical efficacy and improved pharmacokinetics in humans. The current review discusses those factors that have influenced the rapid proliferation of new antimicrobial agents, including the discovery of new lead structures from natural products and the impact of bacterial resistance development in the clinical setting.

    "abstract": "The extremities of eukaryotic chromosomes are called telomeres. They have a structure unlike the bulk of the chromosome, which allows the cell DNA repair machinery to distinguish them from 'broken' DNA ends. But these specialised structures present a problem when it comes to replicating the DNA. Indeed, telomeric DNA progressively erodes with each round of cell division in cells that do not express telomerase, a specialised reverse transcriptase necessary to fully duplicate the telomeric DNA. Telomerase is expressed in tumour cells but not in most somatic cells and thus telomeres and telomerase may be proposed as attractive targets for the discovery of new anticancer agents.",

It is clear that the nephrotoxicity of these agents is due, in part, to the fact that urinary elimination is a major route of excretion from the body. The role(s) of molecular factors such as metal-binding proteins, inclusion bodies, and cell-specific receptorlike proteins that appear to influence renal tubule cell expression, have attracted increased interest as determinants that modulate cell populations as special risk for toxicity and renal cancer. The future of mechanistic toxicology studies with regard to how and why only certain renal cell populations become targets for toxicity from these metals/metalloids and other less common inorganic nephrotoxicants must focus on the molecular handling of these agents by target cell populations.",

The beneficial use of cephalosporins for a vast range of infectious diseases is amply confirmed by the most authoritative international guidelines and bears witness to the role of great importance that these drugs still play in all fields of antibiotic therapy, as a result of the variety of the compounds available, their broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, their multiple clinical potentialities and their excellent tolerability.

By identifying polymorphisms in the human genome that confer changes in the ability to metabolize or activate cancer agents, a more patient-specific treatment approach can be initiated. Molecularly targeted therapies such as PS-341, flavopiridol, Iressa, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies may help to overcome resistance to cytotoxic therapies by lowering the apoptotic threshold and increasing cytotoxicity. Using molecularly targeted agents in combination with traditional cytotoxic agents may increase the percentage of patients who achieve disease stabilization and prolonged survival.

It is now a standard therapy for advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and shows promise in the treatment of two autoimmune disorders, pemphigus vulgaris and progressive systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). Additional diseases for which clinical trials are in progress include multiple sclerosis, organ transplant rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, and AIDS. The mechanism of action appears to involve a \"vaccination\" against the pathogenic T cells, in a clone-specific manner. Photoactivated 8-MOP initiates a cascade of immunologic events by forming covalent photoadducts with nuclear and cell surface-adherent DNA and possibly with other cellular molecules. For reasons not yet fully clarified, but probably related to enhanced cycling of the T-cell receptor for antigen, photopheresis increases the immunogenicity of the irradiated T cells so that their reinfusion induces a therapeutically significant immunologic reaction that targets unirradiated T cells of the pathogenic clone(s). The specificity of the induced immunologic reaction probably results from the extremely disproportionate expansion of the pathogenic clone(s), relative to the several million other clones of normal T cells.",

Genetic biomarkers for disease susceptibility including both Mendelian and complex disease promise to result in improved understanding of the pathophysiology of disease, identification of new potential therapeutic targets, and improved molecular classification of disease. However essential to fulfilling the promise of individualized therapeutic intervention is the identification of drug activity biomarkers that stratify individuals based on likely response to a particular therapeutic, both positive response, efficacy, and negative response, development of side effect or toxicity. Prior to the widespread clinical application of a genetic biomarker multiple scientific studies must be completed to identify the genetic variants and delineate their functional significance in the pathophysiology of a carefully defined phenotype. The applicability of the genetic biomarker in the human population must then be verified through both retrospective studies utilizing stored or clinical trial samples, and through clinical trials prospectively stratifying patients based on the biomarker. The risk conferred by the polymorphism and the applicability in the general population must be clearly understood. Thus, the development and widespread application of a pharmacogenomic biomarker is an involved process and for most disease states we are just at the beginning of the journey towards individualized therapy and improved clinical outcome.",

Several factors and pathways are involved in diabetic complications. One of the major contributory factors is aldose reductase. The beneficial effects of aldose reductase inhibitors in animal models have been reported. The clinical efficacy of these agents, however, is far from satisfactory and the reasons for this may vary. Recent advances in understanding the structure-based functioning, physiological and pathophysiological role of aldose reductase, the use of transgenic animal models and the abundant availability of human aldose reductase have greatly influenced the design and development of its inhibitors, which are highly selective, specific, potent and less toxic. Concurrently, other mechanisms involved in diabetic complications are being explored as targets for better therapeutic agents.",

This understanding of the pharmacologic basis of antiepileptic drug (AED) action has, in large part, arisen from recent advances in cellular and molecular biology, coupled with avenues of drug discovery that have departed somewhat from the largely empiric approaches of the past. Physicians now have available to them an ever-growing armentarium of AEDs, necessitating a firmer appreciation of their mechanisms of action if more rational approaches toward both clinical application and research are to be adopted. An important example in this regard is the concept of rational polypharmacy for patients with epilepsy who are refractory to monotherapy.

If drug resistance is going to be tackled successfully, new antibiotics must be continually developed to counteract the processes of evolution and natural selection in these populations of pathogens. Despite the introduction of powerful new technologies such as high throughput screening platforms and combinatorial chemistry, natural products still offer structural diversity worthy of screening for biological activity. Functional genomics can revolutionise rational drug design providing new targets for antimicrobial drug discovery. The clusters of genes, encoding enzymes that form bio-synthetic pathways leading to the synthesis of many natural products including polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides, are amenable to modern genetic engineering. Repositioning, deleting and replacing genes in these biosynthetic clusters has resulted in the synthesis of many 'un-natural' natural products.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is an integral part of therapy as it reduces mortality and should be instituted from admission. Non selective b-blockers are the treatment of first choice for secondary and primary prevention. If they are contraindicated or non tolerated banding ligation can be used.

In this scenario, oxaliplatin may represent an innovative and challenging drug extending the antitumour activity in diseases such as gastrointestinal cancer that are not usually sensitive to these coordination complexes. Oxaliplatin has a non-hydrolysable diaminocyclohexane (DACH) carrier ligand which is maintained in the final cytotoxic metabolites of the drug. Like cisplatin, oxaliplatin targets DNA producing mainly 1,2-GG intrastrand cross-links. The cellular and molecular aspects of the mechanism of action of oxaliplatin have not yet been fully elucidated. However, the intrinsic chemical and steric characteristics of the DACH-platinum adducts appear to contribute to the lack of cross-resistance with cisplatin.

However, the generation of a potent oxidant is not without risk to the host, and there is evidence that HOCl contributes to the tissue injury associated with inflammation. In this review, we discuss the biological reactivity of HOCl, and detail what is known of how it interacts with mammalian cells. The outcome of exposure is dependent on the dose of oxidant, with higher doses causing necrosis, and apoptosis or growth arrest occurring with lower amounts. Glutathione (GSH) and protein thiols are easily oxidized, and are preferred targets with low, sublethal amounts of HOCl. Thiol enzymes vary in their sensitivity to HOCl, with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase being most susceptible. Indeed, loss of activity occurred before GSH oxidation. The products of these reactions and the ability of cells to regenerate oxidized thiols are discussed. Recent reports have indicated that HOCl can activate cell signaling pathways, and these studies may provide important information on the role of this oxidant in inflammation.",

Their cardiovascular involvement in physiological and pathophysiological situations has been studied intensively since inhibitors for angiotensin I-converting enzyme and selective receptor antagonists have become available for pharmacologically potentiating or inhibiting kinin-mediated reactions. Molecular biological analysis and the establishment of genetically modified animal models have also allowed newer information to be acquired on this subject. In this review, the components and cardiovascularly relevant mechanisms of the kinin-kallikrein system shall be described. Organ-specific effects concerning the kidneys, the vascular system, the heart and nervous tissue shall also be illustrated. On this issue, the physiological functions and pathophysiological implications of the kinin-kallikrein system should be clearly distinguished from the many, mostly endothelium-mediated protective effects which occur during ACE inhibition due to the potentiation of kinin effects. Finally, a view shall also be cast upon newly discovered targets of action, which could be exploited for therapeutically altering the kinin-kallikrein system.",

    "title": "Why do antimicrobial agents become ineffectual?",
    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance has evolved over the past 50 years from a merely microbiological curiosity to a serious medical problem in hospitals all over the world. Resistance has been reported in almost all species of gram-positive and -negative bacteria to various classes of antibiotics including recently developed ones. Bacteria acquire resistance by reducing permeability and intracellular accumulation, by alteration of targets of antibiotic action, and by enzymatic modification of antibiotics. Inappropriate use of an antibiotic selects resistant strains much more frequently. Once resistant bacteria has emerged, the resistance can be transferred to other bacteria by various mechanisms, resulting in multiresistant strains. MRSA is one of the typical multiresistant nosocomial pathogens. A study of the PFGE pattern of endonuclease-digested chromosomal DNA showed that MRSA of a few clones were disseminated among newborns in the NICU of a Japanese hospital. In this regard, it is important to choose appropriate antibiotics and then after some time, to change to other classes to reduce the selection of resistant strains. Since the development of epoch-making new antibiotics is not expected in the near future, it has become very important to use existing antibiotics prudently based on mechanisms of antibiotic action and bacterial resistance. Control of nosocomial infection is also very important to reduce further spread of resistant bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Hypersensitivity reactions to the aromatic antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) phenytoin (PHT) and carbamazepine (CBZ) appear to have an immune etiology. Current models of drug hypersensitivity center around the concept of drug bioactivation to reactive metabolites that irreversibly modify cellular proteins. These modified proteins are believed to initiate (or serve as targets of) an autoimmune-like attack on specific drug-modified proteins in target organs (e.g., liver, skin) of susceptible individuals. Consistent with this model, antibodies to drug-modified and native proteins have been identified in the sera of patients experiencing several drug hypersensitivity reactions. New models must incorporate an understanding of the mechanisms by which drug-modified proteins are processed and presented to the immune system in the appropriate context to culminate in the clinical manifestations of \"hypersensitivity.\" Idiosyncratic toxicities associated with new AEDs, such as lamotrigine and felbamate, appear mechanistically distinct from PHT and CBZ hypersensitivity but may involve similar processes: bioactivation, detoxification, covalent adduct formation, processing and presentation of antigen to the immune system, and consequent formation of antibody and T-cell immune effectors. The goal of research is to develop a \"susceptibility profile\" for identifying individuals at risk for these forms of drug toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Currently, there are a number of approved antiviral agents for use in the treatment of viral infections. However, many instances exist in which the use of a second antiviral agent would be beneficial because it would allow the option of either an alternative or a combination therapeutic approach. Accordingly, virus-encoded proteases have emerged as new targets for antiviral intervention. Molecular studies have indicated that viral proteases play a critical role in the life cycle of many viruses by effecting the cleavage of high-molecular-weight viral polyprotein precursors to yield functional products or by catalyzing the processing of the structural proteins necessary for assembly and morphogenesis of virus particles. This review summarizes some of the important general features of virus-encoded proteases and highlights new advances and/or specific challenges that are associated with the research and development of viral protease inhibitors. Specifically, the viral proteases encoded by the herpesvirus, retrovirus, hepatitis C virus, and human rhinovirus families are discussed.",

Intravenous nimodipine has significant vasodilatory properties and may compromise the achievement of haemodynamic targets in patients who receive hypertensive hypervolaemic haemodilution therapy. We have studied 22 patients who received postoperative therapy with intravenous nimodipine and show that in a substantial minority (29%) hypotension was not reversed by simple volume loading or low doses of inotropes. Formal haemodynamic assessment in these patients showed widely varying haemodynamic variables, with differences in the need for inotropic and vasopressor therapy.

The pathological process involves two stages: nasal inflammation, and the development of nasal airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to allergen and a number of other stimuli. This results in the amplification of any subsequent allergic reaction, contributing to the chronic allergic state. A number of different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the underlying mechanism of AHR, including a role for eosinophil-derived proteins, free radicals and neuropeptides. While there may be a number of independent pathways which can result in AHR, evidence obtained from both animal models and in vivo experiments in humans indicate that some mediators may interact with one another, resulting in AHR. Further research into these interactions may open new avenues for the pharmacological treatment of chronic allergic rhinitis, and possibly other allergic airway diseases.",

    "abstract": "Hematopoietic tissues are the targets of numerous xenobiotics. Clinical hematotoxicity is either a decrease or an increase in peripheral blood cell counts in one or more cell lineages--a cytopenia or a cytosis, respectively--that carries a risk of an adverse clinical event. The purpose of in vitro hematotoxicology is the prediction of these adverse hematologic effects from the effects of the toxicants on human hematopoietic targets under controlled experimental conditions in the laboratory. Building on its important foundations in experimental hematology and the wealth of hematotoxicology data found in experimental oncology, this field of alternative toxicology has developed rapidly during the past decade. Although the colony-forming unit-granulocyte/monocyte neutrophil progenitor is most frequently evaluated, other defined progenitors and stem cells as well as cell types found in the marrow stroma can be evaluated in vitro. End points have been proposed for predicting toxicant exposure levels at the maximum tolerated dose and the no observable adverse effect level for the neutrophil lineage, and several clinical prediction models for neutropenia have developed to the point that they are ready for prospective evaluation and validation in both preclinical species and humans. Known predictive end points are the key to successful comparisons across species or across chemical structures when in vitro dose-response curves are nonparallel. Analytical chemistry support is critical for accurate interpretation of in vitro data and for relating the in vitro pharmacodynamics to the in vivo pharmacokinetics. In contrast to acute neutropenia, anemia and acute thrombocytopenia, as well as adverse effects from chronic toxicant exposure, are much more difficult to predict from in vitro data. Pharmacologic principles critical for clinical predictions from in vitro data very likely will apply to toxicities to other proliferative tissues, such as mucositis.",

    "title": "Therapeutic receptor targets of ischemic preconditioning.",
    "abstract": "This review focuses on target receptors that have been shown to have the potential to mimic the cardioprotective effect of ischemic preconditioning (IPC). There is an abundance of information concerning the intracellular mechanisms and membrane-bound receptors responsible for IPC. Important intracellular mediators of this cardioprotection likely reside in the activation of multiple kinase cascades. The major players in IPC are thought to include protein kinase C, tyrosine kinases, and members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling family and these topics will be covered in more detail in other papers of this focused issue. However, many of these kinase-mediated mechanisms are triggered by the activation of transmembrane spanning receptors, some of which may be manipulated therapeutically to induce cardioprotection in humans with unstable angina or who are at risk for myocardial infarction. In this review, we will discuss the evidence supporting the possibility of manipulating several of these G protein-coupled receptors as potential therapeutic targets. Stimulation of numerous receptors has been targeted as possible triggers for IPC. Some of those that have been identified include A(1) adenosine, alpha(1) adrenergic, M(2) muscarinic, B(2) bradykinin, delta(1) opioid, AT(1) angiotensin, and endothelin-1 receptors. In general, these receptors are thought to couple to inhibitory G proteins. In this review, we will focus on the most likely therapeutic candidates for cardioprotection, namely adenosine, opioid, and bradykinin receptors since selective agonists and antagonists, either alone or in combination, have most often been shown to mimic or block IPC in numerous animal models and man, respectively. This is not meant to completely rule out other receptors since it is clear that IPC is a phenomenon with multiple pathways that appear to be responsible for the cardioprotection observed.",

In addition, there is a need for new drugs that can halt epileptogenesis after brain injury. Mechanisms that underlie seizure processes constitute potential target areas for the development of new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). An understanding of the underlying mechanisms of interictal spike discharge and seizure spread is critical for the development of AEDs for treatment of partial seizures. Suppression of specific forms of voltage-dependent calcium currents and inhibition of GABA(B) receptor-mediated inhibition are two key target areas for new AEDs to treat primary generalized seizures. As researchers gain more understanding of the cellular, molecular, and genetic mechanisms underlying seizure propagation, we should be better able to develop therapeutic agents designed to suppress seizure-provoking mechanisms and to enhance the brain's natural protective mechanisms.",

    "title": "Selective modulation of human natural killer cells in vivo after prolonged infusion of low dose recombinant interleukin 2.",
    "abstract": "The immunologic consequences of prolonged infusions of rIL-2 in doses that produce physiologic serum concentrations of this cytokine were investigated. rIL-2 in doses of 0.5-6.0 x 10(6) U/m2 per d (3.3-40 micrograms/m2 per d) was administered by continuous intravenous infusion for 90 consecutive days to patients with advanced cancer. IL-2 concentrations (25 +/- 25 and 77 +/- 64 pM, respectively) that selectively saturate high-affinity IL-2 receptors (IL-2R) were achieved in the serum of patients receiving rIL-2 infusions of 10 micrograms/m2 per d and 30 micrograms/m2 per d. A gradual, progressive expansion of natural killer (NK) cells was seen in the peripheral blood of these patients with no evidence of a plateau effect during the 3 mo of therapy. A preferential expansion of CD56bright NK cells was consistently evident. NK cytotoxicity against tumor targets was only slightly enhanced at these dose levels. However, brief incubation of these expanded NK cells with IL-2 in vitro induced potent lysis of NK-sensitive, NK-resistant, and antibody-coated targets. Infusions of rIL-2 at 40 micrograms/m2 per d produced serum IL-2 levels (345 +/- 381 pM) sufficient to engage intermediate affinity IL-2R p75, which is constitutively expressed by human NK cells. This did not result in greater NK cell expansion compared to the lower dose levels, but did produce in vivo activation of NK cytotoxicity, as evidenced by lysis of NK-resistant targets. There was no consistent change in the numbers of CD56- CD3+ T cells, CD56+ CD3+ MHC-unrestricted T cells, or B cells during infusions of rIL-2 at any of the dosages used. This study demonstrates that prolonged infusions of rIL-2 in doses that saturate only high affinity IL-2R can selectively expand human NK cells for an extended period of time with only minimal toxicity. Further activation of NK cytolytic activity can also be achieved in vivo, but it requires concentrations of IL-2 that bind intermediate affinity IL-2R p75.

    "abstract": "DNA topoisomerases I are ubiquitous enzymes that play a crucial role in DNA condensation, replication, transcription, and repair. Eukaryotic enzymes are highly conserved and specifically targeted by natural anticancer agents such as camptothecin and its derivatives. These drugs poison top 1 by inhibiting the enzyme via trapping of top 1 clivage complexes, which ultimately generate cell death. New camptothecin derivatives with better pharmacologic characteristics are under development. Understanding top 1 functions and structure will help to discover more specific and less toxic top 1 inhibitors in order to circumvent drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Rapidly accumulating clinical data have repeatedly demonstrated not only the critical importance of even small increases in blood pressure as a pathophysiologic factor in the development of cardiovascular disease, particularly in individuals with diabetes mellitus, but also the therapeutic necessity of more aggressive blood pressure reduction and the achievement of progressively lower blood pressure targets in reducing cardiovascular event rates. JNC VI has defined optimal blood pressure as <or=120/80 mm Hg, and Stage 1 hypertension as >or=140/80 mm Hg. Target blood pressures are now <or=130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes and <125/75 mm Hg for patients with hypertensive renal disease with proteinuria of >1 gm/24 hours. Achieving such target pressures is increasingly difficult, particularly in diabetic patients with chronic renal disease, who require complex multidrug antihypertensive regimens. This review attempts to provide some suggestions for constructing such antihypertensive regimens, and provides considerations for the appropriate use of diuretics and the most effective drug combinations. Factors potentially contributing to drug resistant hypertension include such problems as failure to maximize drug dosing, suboptimal diuretic use, noncompliance, and possible confounding effects of such concomitant medications as nonsteroidal and anti-inflammatory drugs or decongestants. The issues underlying drug-resistant hypertension are listed, together with strategies for overcoming this problem.",

Although the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for PD are not completely understood, many clues have come from biochemical, epidemiological, and genetic studies. Mutations in certain genes found in rare, familial cases of PD, such as alpha-synuclein and parkin, suggest a role for the ubiquitin-proteosome system and aberrant protein aggregation. Biochemical analyses have implicated mitochondrial dysfunction in PD. Epidemiological and animal model studies point to a role for environmental toxins, some of which are mitochondrial inhibitors. Mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting from either genetic defects, environmental exposures or an interaction between the two, may cause alpha-synuclein aggregation or neurodegeneration through oxidative stress or excitotoxicity. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying PD should reveal novel therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "The airway smooth muscle cell is the chief effector cell governing the control of airway calibre in the human lung. The contractile state of the airway smooth muscle cell is predominantly influenced by the balance of constrictor and relaxant stimuli. Agents such as histamine and acetylcholine cause airway smooth muscle cells to contract through activation of specific cell surface receptors and engagement of signal transduction pathways and/or ion channels. The predominant pathway mediating constriction is activation of phospholipase C, with release of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and elevation of intracellular calcium levels. Relaxation is brought about predominantly by stimulation of adenylyl cyclase-coupled receptors (e.g. the beta2-adrenoceptor) resulting in elevation of cell cyclic adenosine monophosphate content. Complex crosstalk occurs between both of these pathways and also ion channels expressed on the airway smooth muscle cell membrane, leading to careful regulation of airway smooth muscle tone. A greater understanding of the mechanisms governing control of these pathways will lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets which will in turn lead to new agents for the treatment of asthma.",

It is also increasingly linked to other diseases of the GI tract, although the relationship between the organism and conditions such as gastric cancer, non-ulcer dyspepsia and gastroesophageal reflux disease is not as clear as is the case in peptic ulcer disease. This is probably because of a lack of well-performed, statistically powerful, prospective therapeutic trials that indicate that H. pylori eradication is of benefit in these diseases. The high infection rate without overt disease seen in many populations, especially from developing countries, probably contributes to this \"credibility gap.\" While we have excellent therapeutic regimens available at this time, rational targeting requires that the objective evidence in favor of therapeutic intervention in upper GI disease, as well as the local H. pylori epidemiology, needs to be considered.",

In this article, we discuss recent developments in GlyR pharmacology, delineate the receptor domains that are involved in binding of agonists and allosteric modulators, and present a molecular model of the extracellular architecture of the receptor. The recent discovery of compounds that act preferentially on specific GlyR isoforms and the differential expression of these isoforms in distinct regions of the developing and adult CNS show considerable promise towards the development of drugs that act in defined glycine-mediated pathways. In particular, compounds that can potentiate GlyR function should provide leads for novel muscle relaxants in addition to sedative and analgesic agents.",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of both chemical and physical anticancer treatments act through the induction of apoptotic cell death in vitro and in vivo. In numerous experimental systems, the apoptotic processes can be divided into three different phases. In the first one, multiple pro-apoptotic signal transduction pathways (e.g. P53, ROS production, etc.) are activated by various factors including anti cancer drugs. This first step is followed by an intermediate phase in which pro-apoptotic signals converge to mitochondria which in turn can finally trigger the last degradation phase of apoptosis. Consequently, mitochondria, play a pivotal role in the executive phase of apoptosis and could represent a novel attractive target for pro-apoptotic drugs. Indeed, unlike conventional anti tumour drugs which trigger pro-apoptotic signal transduction pathways upstream mitochondria, several compounds were shown to act directly on mitochondria to induce apoptosis. These drugs include betulinic acid, lonidamine, arsenic trioxide and two retinoids like CD437/AHPN and fenretinide/4-HPR. This review summarizes new data concerning these drugs targetted to mitochondria and highlights the new perspective they may offer in cancer therapy.",

If protein kinase cascades mediate survival, then it is likely that phosphatases mediate apoptosis.

    "abstract": "Comment in    J Clin Microbiol. 2004 Jan;42(1):490. doi: 10.1128/JCM.42.1.490.2004.The increased use of antibacterial and antifungal agents in recent years has resulted in the development of resistance to these drugs. The significant clinical implication of resistance has led to heightened interest in the study of antimicrobial resistance from different angles. Areas addressed include mechanisms underlying this resistance, improved methods to detect resistance when it occurs, alternate options for the treatment of infections caused by resistant organisms, and strategies to prevent and control the emergence and spread of resistance. In this review, the mode of action of antifungals and their mechanisms of resistance are discussed. Additionally, an attempt is made to discuss the correlation between fungal and bacterial resistance. Antifungals can be grouped into three classes based on their site of action: azoles, which inhibit the synthesis of ergosterol (the main fungal sterol); polyenes, which interact with fungal membrane sterols physicochemically; and 5-fluorocytosine, which inhibits macromolecular synthesis. Many different types of mechanisms contribute to the development of resistance to antifungals. These mechanisms include alteration in drug target, alteration in sterol biosynthesis, reduction in the intercellular concentration of target enzyme, and overexpression of the antifungal drug target. Although the comparison between the mechanisms of resistance to antifungals and antibacterials is necessarily limited by several factors defined in the review, a correlation between the two exists. For example, modification of enzymes which serve as targets for antimicrobial action and the involvement of membrane pumps in the extrusion of drugs are well characterized in both the eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.",

The convergence of improved software for molecular mechanics and dynamics, techniques for chimeric substitution and site-directed mutations, and the first x-ray structures of transmembrane ion channels have made it possible to build and test models of anaesthetic binding sites. These models have served as guides for site-directed mutagenesis and as starting points for understanding the molecular dynamics of anaesthetic-site interactions. Ligand-gated ion channels are targets for inhaled anaesthetics and alcohols in the central nervous system. The inhibitory strychnine-sensitive glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors are positively modulated by anaesthetics and alcohols; site-directed mutagenesis techniques have identified amino acid residues important for the action of volatile anaesthetics and alcohols in these receptors. Key questions are whether these amino acid mutations form part of alcohol- or anaesthetic-binding sites or if they alter protein stability in a way that allows anaesthetic molecules to act remotely by non-specific mechanisms. It is likely that molecular modelling will play a major role in answering these questions.",

    "abstract": "Oral anticoagulation originated with the discovery of the harmful agent causing \"sweet clover disease\" in cattle in North America in the 1920s. The causative agent dicoumarol was isolated in Link's laboratory in 1940. A range of related compounds was then synthesized, the most popular of which proved to be warfarin. Oral anticoagulant administration posed problems of individual variation in response to these drugs and the need for regular laboratory monitoring by prothrombin time (PT). Monitoring problems arose from the introduction in the 1950s of some poorly responsive commercial tissue extracts for use as tissue extract thromboplastin reagent in the PT. More oral anticoagulant drug was then needed to prolong the test to the required therapeutic targets, with a resultant increase in bleeding. It was not until 1983 that the problem was resolved and it was shown that the less intense UK-type regimen was just as effective as the higher North American type dosage in the prevention of venous thrombosis but caused much less bleeding. This study led to the widespread adoption of the \"low-dose warfarin\" regimen that, combined with the World Health Organization PT standardization scheme using the international normalized ratio (INR), has led to improved effectiveness and safety of oral anticoagulation. This has permitted increased administration of warfarin in a widening spectrum of clinical disorders. The last remaining problem is the limited success of doctors in achieving the therapeutic INR targets, which may be improved by computer-assisted dosage.",

After the introduction of these nitroheterocycles only a few compounds were assayed in chagasic patients. The great advances in vector control in the South Cone countries, and the demonstration of parasite in chronic patients indicated the urgency to discuss the etiologic treatment during this phase, reinforcing the need to find drugs with more efficacy and less toxicity. We also review potential targets in the parasite and present a survey about new classes of synthetic and natural compounds studied after 1992/1993, with which we intend to give to the reader a general view about experimental studies in the area of the chemotherapy of Chagas disease, complementing the previous papers of Brener (1979) and De Castro (1993).",

The risks with which are confronted the humanity during this century underline the necessity of determining mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis. The determination of the specific and vital biologic processes for the microorganism, could allow to define the most appropriated targets and the most effective and original means of fight.",

    "title": "New developments in anti-HIV chemotherapy.",
    "abstract": "Virtually all the compounds that are currently used, or are subject of advanced clinical trials, for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, belong to one of the following classes: (i) nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs): i.e. zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC), stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), abacavir (ABC), emtricitabine [(-)FTC], tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; (ii) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): i.e. nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, emivirine; and (iii) protease inhibitors (PIs): i.e. saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir and lopinavir. In addition to the reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease reaction, various other events in the HIV replicative cycle can be considered as potential targets for chemotherapeutic intervention: (i) viral adsorption, through binding to the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 (polysulfates, polysulfonates, polycarboxylates, polyoxometalates, polynucleotides, and negatively charged albumins); (ii) viral entry, through blockade of the viral coreceptors CXCR4 [bicyclam (AMD3100) derivatives] and CCR5 (TAK-779 derivatives); (iii) virus-cell fusion, through binding to the viral envelope glycoprotein gp41 (T-20, T-1249); (iv) viral assembly and disassembly, through NCp7 zinc finger-targeted agents [2,2'-dithiobisbenzamides (DIBAs), azadicarbonamide (ADA)]; (v) proviral DNA integration, through integrase inhibitors such as 4-aryl-2,4-dioxobutanoic acid derivatives; (vi) viral mRNA transcription, through inhibitors of the transcription (transactivation) process (flavopiridol, fluoroquinolones). Also, various new NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs have been developed that possess, respectively: (i) improved metabolic characteristics (i.e. phosphoramidate and cyclosaligenyl pronucleotides by-passing the first phosphorylation step of the NRTIs), (ii) increased activity [\"second\" or \"third\" generation NNRTIs (i.e. TMC-125, DPC-083)] against those HIV strains that are resistant to the \"first\" generation NNRTIs, or (iii) as in the case of PIs, a different, nonpeptidic scaffold [i.e. cyclic urea (mozenavir), 4-hydroxy-2-pyrone (tipranavir)]. Nonpeptidic PIs may be expected to inhibit HIV mutant strains that have become resistant to peptidomimetic PIs. Given the multitude of molecular targets with which anti-HIV agents can interact, one should be cautious in extrapolating the mode of action of these agents from cell-free enzymatic assays to intact cells. Two examples in point are L-chicoric acid and the nonapeptoid CGP64222, which were initially described as an integrase inhibitor or Tat antagonist, respectively, but later shown to primarily act as virus adsorption/entry inhibitors, the latter through blockade of CXCR4.",

    "title": "Voltage-activated calcium channels: targets of antiepileptic drug therapy?",
    "abstract": "Voltage-gated calcium currents play important roles in controlling neuronal excitability. They also contribute to the epileptogenic discharge, including seizure maintenance and propagation. In the past decade, selective calcium channel blockers have been synthesized, aiding in the analysis of calcium channel subtypes by patch-clamp recordings. It is still a matter of debate whether whether any of the currently available antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) inhibit these conductances as part of their mechanism of action. We tested oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, and felbamate and found that they consistently inhibited voltage-activated calcium currents in cortical and striatal neurons at clinically relevant concentrations. Low micromolar concentrations of GP 47779 (the active metabolite of oxcarbazepine) and lamotrigine reduced calcium conductances involved in the regulation of transmitter release. In contrast, felbamate blocked nifedipine-sensitive conductances at concentrations significantly lower than those required to modify N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) responses or sodium currents. Aside from contributing to AED efficacy, this mechanism of action may have profound implications for preventing fast-developing cellular damage related to ischemic and traumatic brain injuries. Moreover, the effects of AEDs on voltage-gated calcium signals may lead to new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "title": "Schistosomiasis epidemiology and control: how did we get here and where should we go?",
    "abstract": "Although a disease of great antiquity, scientific studies of schistosomiasis began only 150 years ago. The complete life-cycle was not described until just before the First World War, making it possible at last to plan proper community control programmes. Inadequate tools prevented their effective implementation until well after the Second World War when new tools became available, thanks to the newly formed World Health Organization. Molluscicides spearheaded control programmes until the late 1970s but were then replaced by the newly developed, safe drugs still used today. Whatever the method used, the initial goal of eradication was, in the light of experience and cost, gradually replaced by less ambitious targets; first to stop transmission and then to reduce morbidity. The most successful programmes combined several methods to minimise reinfection after chemotherapy. Comparisons between different programmes are difficult without using appropriate, standardised diagnostic techniques and the correct epidemiological measurements. Some examples will be presented, mainly from our studies on Schistosoma mansoni in Kenya. Drug resistance on a scale comparable with malaria has not occurred in schistosomiasis but the likely withdrawal of all drugs except praziquantel leaves its control extremely vulnerable to this potential problem. An effective, affordable vaccine for use in endemic countries is unlikely to be ready for at least 5 years, and developing strategies for its use could take a further decade or more, judging from experience with drugs and molluscicides. In the interim, by analogy with malaria, the most cost-effective approach would the use of drugs combined with other methods to stop transmission, including molluscicides. The cost of molluscicides needs to be reduced and fears allayed about their supposedly adverse ecological effects.",

    "abstract": "Effective antiretroviral therapy remains beyond the reach of most human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons living in the third world because of its tremendous cost. The cancer drug, hydroxyurea, inhibits HIV-1 replication in vitro and, when combined with didanosine (ddI), results in significant antiretroviral synergy. In vivo, hydroxyurea specifically targets quiescent lymphocytes and macrophages, important cellular reservoirs for HIV-1, and the combination of ddI plus hydroxyurea effectively reduces plasma HIV-1 RNA levels. Combination ddI-hydroxyurea costs about one-eighth as much as currently recommended triple drug combinations, and several countries in Africa are exploring the feasibility of widescale use of ddI-hydroxyurea for their HIV-infected populations. Intrigued by its potential relevance for Africa, the authors reviewed the literature on the in vitro and clinical efficacy of ddI plus hydroxyurea against HIV. The combination of ddI plus hydroxyurea is an effective and potentially more affordable regimen for HIV-infected persons living in poorer countries.",

This review focuses on small-molecule or chemical approaches to manipulate gene expression by modulating either transcription of messenger RNA-coding genes or protein translation. The molecules under study include natural products, designed ligands, and compounds identified through functional screens of combinatorial libraries. The cellular targets for these molecules include DNA, messenger RNA, and the protein components of the transcription, RNA processing, and translational machinery. Studies with model systems have shown promise in the inhibition of both cellular and viral gene transcription and mRNA utilization. Moreover, strategies for both repression and activation of gene transcription have been described. These studies offer promise for treatment of diseases of pathogenic (viral, bacterial, etc.) and cellular origin (cancer, genetic diseases, etc.).",

    "abstract": "The relationship between increased serum levels of total cholesterol and increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) is widely accepted, as is the corollary that lowering elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a significant risk factor, reduces CHD mortality. Although statins are the most widely used agents to lower LDL cholesterol levels and demonstrate significant clinical benefits, alternate and/or additional treatment strategies are also being studied. One such approach for which several classes of agents are available is the nonspecific inhibition of intestinal cholesterol and bile acid absorption. Although all of these inhibitors-which include bile acid sequestrants, cholesterol absorption blockers, and plant stanols-reduce cholesterol concentrations within liver cells and increase the expression of LDL receptors, they are limited in their effectiveness because of poor tolerability and compensatory effects by the liver that blunt their ability to lower LDL. Ideally, the combination of a statin and another agent that specifically targets cholesterol absorption and promotes excretion while simultaneously decreasing synthesis may provide the greatest therapeutic benefit. The recent development of selective cholesterol inhibitors, including ezetimibe, provides an approach to lowering LDL that has significant potential both as monotherapy and in combination therapy.",

Our approach is based on the concept of vulnerable parameter, i.e. the electrophysiological property which plays a crucial role in the genesis of arrhythmias. To prevent or stop the arrhythmia a drug should modify the vulnerable parameter by its action on channel or receptor targets. In the first part, general aspects of the interaction between drugs channel molecules are considered. Drug binding depends on the state of the channel: rested, activated pre-open, activated open, or inactivated state. The change in channel behaviour with state is presented in the framework of the modulated-receptor hypothesis. Not only inhibition but also stimulation can be the result of drug binding. In the second part a detailed and systematic description and an analysis are given of the interaction of drugs with specific channels (Na+, Ca2+, K+, \"pacemaker\") and non-channel receptors. Emphasis is given to the type of state-dependent block involved (rested, activated and inactivated state block) and the change in channel kinetics. These properties vary and determine the voltage- and frequency-dependence of the change in ionic current. Finally, the question is asked as to whether the available drugs by their action on channels and receptors modify the vulnerable parameter in the desired way to stop or prevent arrhythmias.",

Brown spider bites have been reported to cause a local and acute inflammatory reaction that may evolve to dermonecrosis (a hallmark of envenomation) and hemorrhage at the bite site, besides systemic manifestations such as thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemolysis, and renal failure. The molecular mechanisms by which Loxosceles venoms induce injury are currently under investigation. In this review, we focused on the latest reports describing the biological and physiopathological aspects of loxoscelism, with reference mainly to the proteases recently described as metalloproteases and serine proteases, as well as on the proteolytic effects triggered by L. intermedia venom upon extracellular matrix constituents such as fibronectin, fibrinogen, entactin and heparan sulfate proteoglycan, besides the disruptive activity of the venom on Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm basement membranes. Degradation of these extracellular matrix molecules and the observed disruption of basement membranes could be related to deleterious activities of the venom such as loss of vessel and glomerular integrity and spreading of the venom toxins to underlying tissues.",

Extracellular adenosine, acting at its membrane bound A1 and A2 receptors, is a ubiquitous modulator of cellular activity. The purine can arise from several sources including ATP hydrolysis by ectokinase activity in the region of the nerve terminal [2] and from S-adenosylhomocysteine [3] and ATP within the cell. Together with its more stable analogs, adenosine is a potent inhibitor of neurotransmitter release in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, and in cardiac, adipose and other tissues. Adenosine can also affect blood pressure and heart rate as well as modulate the function of the immune, inflammatory, gastrointestinal, renal and pulmonary systems, either via its effects on transmitter release or directly via receptor mechanisms altering intracellular transduction processes.",

Conformal radiotherapy targets the cancer precisely and can be combined with new systemically administered radiosensitizers. The successes of conventional chemoradiation programs support continued study of newer ways to deliver systemic radiosensitizing chemotherapy. However, chemoradiation creates a narrower therapeutic window compared to irradiation alone and increased treatment intensity, even with conformal chemoradiation techniques, can potentially result in frequent complications, detrimental treatment delays, and decreased quality of life. Treatment schedules employing a \"best tolerated time\" modelfor systemic administration of radiosensitizing chemotherapy, based on the concept of chronotolerance, offer attractive ways to address the challenging problem of normal tissue toxicity associated with conformal chemoradiation. This approach may be beneficial in the elderly and those medically unfit to tolerate traditional dose-intense combined-modality schedules.

    "title": "Proliferative signaling and disease progression in heart failure.",
    "abstract": "Therapy for heart failure has traditionally been directed to such short-term functional abnormalities as low cardiac output, high filling pressures, and fluid retention. More recently, it has become clear that therapy must also inhibit the proliferative responses that contribute to the progressive deterioration of the failing heart. That heart failure is more than a hemodynamic disorder became apparent when clinical trials showed that drugs that improve such functional abnormalities as high venous pressure and low cardiac output failed to improve long-term prognosis. Most vasodilators, in spite of alleviating short-term problems caused by excessive afterload, increase long-term mortality; the notable exceptions are ACE inhibitors, the ability of which to prolong survival and inhibit remodeling can be attributed to inhibition of proliferative signaling. Other clinical trials showed that inotropic drugs, while providing immediate relief of symptoms, generally shorten long-term survival, whereas beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, which inhibit proliferative signaling by norepinephrine, improve prognosis. These findings can be explained by crossovers between functional and proliferative signaling, among the most important of which is the ability of neurohumoral mediators, such as norepinephrine and angiotensin II, to stimulate maladaptive hypertrophy, remodeling, apoptosis and other deleterious proliferative responses in the failing heart. The emerging understanding of the role of cytoskeletal and cell adhesion molecules in activating maladaptive proliferative responses suggests additional targets for therapy, and the rapid pace of discovery in molecular biology promises additional opportunities to inhibit this abnormal signaling, which causes progressive ventricular dilatation (remodeling) and cardiac cell death, now recognized to be major problems in this syndrome.",

    "title": "Extension of oxygen tolerance in man: philosophy and significance.",
    "abstract": "The respiration of oxygen over a range of partial pressures higher than in the natural environment has expanding usefulness in health and disease. It provides for denitrogenation of the astronaut to prevent aerospace decompression sickness, it facilitates diving of many forms and improves safety in decompression after diving, and it is the key to therapy of diving and iatrogenic gas embolic diseases. In the continuum of general and hyperbaric medicine, it is essential for sustaining viability of damaged or diseased tissues not adequately oxygenated at natural oxygen pressures. Over the entire range of its clinical and operational usefulness, the pressure and duration of tolerable exposure to oxygen is limited by adverse effects on multiple chemical targets, cells, tissues, and organ functions. The rates of development and the qualitative expressions of these effects are different at different respired oxygen pressures. Successful extension of oxygen tolerance, as by slowing the rate of development of adverse effects, will further expand the medical and operational usefulness and safety of oxygen in normal, hypobaric, and hyperbaric environments. A prerequisite baseline for overall extension of oxygen tolerance is the quantitative investigation of early stages of toxic oxygen effects upon specific chemical and composite functions of multiple organ systems, including rates of development and rates of recovery. The practicality of limited oxygen tolerance extension by systematic interruption of oxygen exposure has been demonstrated and the procedure widely used. Broad present goals are both to establish oxygen tolerance for specific tissues and to optimize tolerance extension over the full range of useful oxygen pressures.",

    "title": "Vision of the future: capecitabine.",
    "abstract": "Capecitabine is a thymidine phosphorylase (TP)-activated oral fluoropyrimidine, rationally designed to generate 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) preferentially within tumors. This tumor selectivity is achieved through exploitation of the significantly higher activity of TP in tumor compared with healthy tissue. The high single-agent activity of capecitabine in breast and colorectal cancer suggests that capecitabine may have a role in the treatment of other tumor types that are sensitive to 5-FU, such as pancreatic cancer. Tumor types known to have a high level of TP activity, such as renal cancer, are especially attractive targets for capecitabine therapy. Capecitabine has potential as monotherapy in these tumor types, or as a combination partner for other cytotoxic agents with different mechanisms of action and little overlap of key toxicities. In particular, some cytotoxic drugs, such as the taxanes and cyclophosphamide, are known to upregulate TP activity in tumor tissue, offering the potential for synergistic action. The combination of capecitabine and docetaxel has demonstrated significant activity in women with anthracycline-pretreated breast cancer, and is the only cytotoxic combination to significantly increase survival compared with standard therapy in this setting. In addition, capecitabine as monotherapy or in combination with other cytotoxic agents has shown encouraging activity in pancreatic, ovarian, and renal cell cancers. This article discusses recent data from clinical trials investigating capecitabine in a range of tumor types, highlighting the potential future role of capecitabine as an alternative to traditional i.v. chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Professional phagocytes (polymorphonuclear neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages) are a main component of the immune system. These cells are involved in both host defenses and various pathological settings characterized by excessive inflammation. Accordingly, they are key targets for immunomodulatory drugs, among which antibacterial agents are promising candidates. The basic and historical concepts of immunomodulation will first be briefly reviewed. Phagocyte complexity will then be unravelled (at least in terms of what we know about the origin, subsets, ambivalent roles, functional capacities, and transductional pathways of this cell and how to explore them). The core subject of this review will be the many possible interactions between antibacterial agents and phagocytes, classified according to demonstrated or potential clinical relevance (e.g., neutropenia, intracellular accumulation, and modulation of bacterial virulence). A detailed review of direct in vitro effects will be provided for the various antibacterial drug families, followed by a discussion of the clinical relevance of these effects in two particular settings: immune deficiency and inflammatory diseases. The prophylactic and therapeutic use of immunomodulatory antibiotics will be considered before conclusions are drawn about the emerging (optimistic) vision of future therapeutic prospects to deal with largely unknown new diseases and new pathogens by using new agents, new techniques, and a better understanding of the phagocyte in particular and the immune system in general.",

    "title": "Biological properties of genistein. A review of in vitro and in vivo data.",
    "abstract": "Genistein--a soy derived isoflavone has recently attracted much attention of the medical scientific community. This compound was found to be a potent agent in both prophylaxis and treatment of cancer as well as other chronic diseases. The great interest that has focused on genistein led to the identification of numerous intracellular targets of its action in the live cell. At the molecular level, genistein inhibits the activity of ATP utilizing enzymes such as: tyrosine-specific protein kinases, topoisomerase II and enzymes involved in phosphatidylinositol turnover. Moreover, genistein can act via an estrogen receptor-mediated mechanism. At the level one step higher, i.e., at the cellular level, genistein induces apoptosis and differentiation in cancer cells, inhibits cell proliferation, modulates cell cycling, exerts antioxidant effects, inhibits angiogenesis, and suppresses osteoclast and lymphocyte functions. These activities make genistein a promising innovative agent in the treatment of cancer. Additionally, genistein health beneficial effects have been shown in osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases and menopause. Genistein was also successfully used as an immunosuppressive agent both in vitro and in vivo. All these effects at the three biological levels of action need varied genistein concentrations and only some of them are relevant in people consuming soy-rich diet. The others would occur after purified genistein administration at higher doses. The main genistein advantage as a potential drug is its multidirectional action in the live cell and its very low toxicity.",

    "title": "Resistance to antifolates in Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of tropical malaria.",
    "abstract": "Every year there are 270 million clinical attacks of malaria and 2 million deaths, caused by the protozoan Plasmodium falciparum. Most of these cases occur in Africa. Chloroquine-resistance has led to reliance on anti-malarial antifolates, in particular the synergistic combination sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (S/P) which targets enzymatic synthesis of folate co-factors through dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Resistance to S/P is now increasing and replacement antimalarials are needed. Crystal structures are not yet available for these key enzymes in the folate pathway. This review focuses on the activity of drugs on DHFR in malaria parasites, attempts to interpret differences in activity of pyrimethamine and its related drugs, and to clarify how residue changes due to point mutations determine the development of resistance. In homology-modelled P. falciparum DHFR (PfDHFR), the typical structure of four alpha-helices, 8-stranded beta-sheet, four Loops and eight Turns is clearly seen. Long polar sequences specific for Plasmodium are inserted in Turns 1 and 2. Structures immediately concerned in drug binding are beta-A, L1, alpha-B, alpha-C, T-3, beta-E, alpha-F, and beta-F. The roles of several mutations associated with resistance are discussed. In view of sequence differences in turn 3 in PfDHFR and in the human enzyme, and the marked interaction with residues of T3 of the experimental flexible antifolate WR99210 effective in pyrimethamine and cycloguanil resistance, further drug development in this area is indicated.",

In SJS mouth, eyes, skin, genitalia and occasionally the esophagus and respiratory track may be affected. Oral lesions may cause severe pain and usually lips may become encrusted.

    "abstract": "Anticancer treatment using cytotoxic drugs is considered to mediate cell death by activating key elements of the apoptosis program and the cellular stress response. While proteolytic enzymes (caspases) serve as main effectors of apoptosis, the mechanisms involved in activation of the caspase system are less clear. Two distinct pathways upstream of the caspase cascade have been identified. Death receptors, eg, CD95 (APO-1/Fas), trigger caspase-8, and mitochondria release apoptogenic factors (cytochrome c, Apaf-1, AIF), leading to the activation of caspase-9. The stressed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contributes to apoptosis by the unfolded protein response pathway, which induces ER chaperones, and by the ER overload response pathway, which produces cytokines via nuclear factor-kappaB. Multiple other stress-inducible molecules, such as p53, JNK, AP-1, NF-kappaB, PKC/MAPK/ERK, and members of the sphingomyelin pathway have a profound influence on apoptosis. Understanding the complex interaction between different cellular programs provides insights into sensitivity or resistance of tumor cells and identifies molecular targets for rational therapeutic intervention strategies.",

By actively pumping out antibiotic molecules, these systems prevent the intracellular accumulation necessary for antibiotics to exert their lethal activity. Drug efflux appears to be one of the most widespread antibiotic resistance mechanisms among microorganisms, since it has been demonstrated to occur in many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including medically important species like staphylococci, streptococci, enterobacteria and opportunistic pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efflux pumps can be specific for only one substrate or accommodate a more or less wide range of noxious products. Export of structurally unrelated compounds confers a multidrug-resistance phenotype on bacterial cells. Therapeutically critical levels of resistance can be achieved by overexpression of efflux systems, especially in those species such as P. aeruginosa which possess a low outer membrane permeability. It is suspected that the dual physiological function of active efflux systems is both the secretion of intracellular metabolites and the protection against a variety of harmful substances that the microorganism may encounter in its natural environment.",

Diagnostically, the Recommendations endorse the greater use of non-office-based measures of blood pressure control and greater emphasis on the assessment of other atherosclerotic risk factors, both when considering prognosis in hypertension and in the choice of therapy. On the treatment side of the equation, lower targets for blood pressure control have been advocated in subgroups of hypertensive patients, particularly in those with diabetes and renal disease. In conjunction with the recently published recommendations on lifestyle management, there is a greater emphasis on lifestyle modification, both as initial and adjunctive therapy in hypertension. Implicit in the recommendations for therapy is the principle that for the vast majority of hypertensive patients treated pharmacologically, practitioners should not follow a stepped-care approach. Instead, therapy should be individualized, primarily based on consideration of concurrent diseases, both cardiovascular and noncardiovascular (Tables 1 and 2). Through the consensus process, there was a general appreciation of how far we have come in the development of evidence-based recommendations for hypertension management. However, there was also an increasing appreciation of how far we have to go in effectively translating these recommendations into better blood pressure control.",

    "abstract": "The sequencing of the genome of Plasmodium falciparum promises to revolutionize the way in which malaria research will be carried out. Beyond simple gene discovery, the genome sequence will facilitate the comprehensive determination of the parasite's gene expression during its developmental phases, pathology, and in response to environmental variables, such as drug treatment and host genetic background. This article reviews the current status of the P. falciparum genome sequencing project and the unique insights it has generated. We also summarize the application of bioinformatics and analytical tools that have been developed for functional genomics. The aim of these activities is the rational, information-based identification of new therapeutic strategies and targets, based on a thorough insight into the biology of Plasmodium spp.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitors interfering with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gene regulation may have great potential in anti-HIV drug (combination) therapy. They act against different targets to currently used anti-HIV drugs, reduce virus production from acute and chronically infected cells and are anticipated to elicit less virus drug resistance. Several agents have already proven to inhibit HIV gene regulation in vitro. A first class of compounds interacts with cellular factors that bind to the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter and that are needed for basal level transcription, such as NF-kappa B and Sp1 inhibitors. A second class of compounds specifically inhibits the transactivation of the HIV LTR promoter by the viral Tat protein, such as the peptoid CGP64222. A third class of compounds prevents the accumulation of single and unspliced mRNAs through inhibition of the viral regulator protein Rev, such as the aminoglycosidic antibiotics. Most of these compounds have been tested in specific transactivation assays. Whether they are active at the postulated target in virus replication assays has, for many of them, not been ascertained. Toxicity data are often lacking or insufficient. Yet these data are crucial in view of the toxicity that may be expected for compounds that primarily interact with cellular factors. Although a promising lead, considerable research is still required before gene regulation inhibitors may come of age as clinically useful agents.",

Methicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, acts by inhibiting penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that are involved in the synthesis of peptidoglycan, an essential mesh-like polymer that surrounds the cell. S. aureus can become resistant to methicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics through the expression of a foreign PBP, PBP2a, that is resistant to the action of methicillin but which can perform the functions of the host PBPs. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates are often resistant to other classes of antibiotics (through different mechanisms) making treatment options limited, and this has led to the search for new compounds active against these strains. An understanding of the mechanism of methicillin resistance has led to the discovery of accessory factors that influence the level and nature of methicillin resistance. Accessory factors, such as Fem factors, provide possible new targets, while compounds that modulate methicillin resistance such as epicatechin gallate, derived from green tea, and corilagin, provide possible lead compounds for development of inhibitors.",

Although recent evidence has revealed a rich diversity of ion channels in both membranes, the purpose of these channels remains incompletely determined. Pores in the outer membrane are fundamental participants in apoptotic cell death, and this process may also involve permeability transition pores on the inner membrane. Novel functions are now being assigned to other ion channels of the inner membrane. Examples include protection against ischaemic injury by mitochondrial KATP channels and the contribution of inner membrane anion channels to spontaneous mitochondrial oscillations in cardiac myocytes. The central role of mitochondria in both the normal function of the cell and in its demise makes these channels prime targets for future research and drug development.",

    "abstract": "Human pathogenic viruses can be detected in the hospital environment, on contaminated surfaces or medical instruments. Their transmission to patients or staff has already been reported. Lipophilic viruses (HIV, HBV, HCV,...) are susceptible to many liquid chemicals, but they can survive during short time on inadequately disinfected surfaces. Hydrophilic viruses, without envelope, are more resistant, but generally not associated with severe illnesses. Viruses survival in environment depends on many factors and is always improved with viral aggregation and low temperature, whereas organic matters and relative humidity effects are contrasted. The mechanism of virucide disinfectants is not yet well established, and their targets are not known with precision. Different disinfection procedures (disinfectant concentration, contact time, temperature, pH) can provide a similar virucidal activity on a given virus. The virucidal activity of a disinfectant is evaluated with a cell culture assay in Afnor guidelines. But, there are three major problems with this method, concerning need of high viruses titers, residual disinfectant cytotoxicity on cell culture, and non cultivable viruses. Non standardized tests are also described in papers, but their results can generally not be compared. Molecular biology improvements may lead to reproducible and sensitive tests. At present, no general disinfection procedure effective for most of the viruses, without risks for staff or materials, and with an acceptable economic cost can be recommended.",

The pharmaceutical industry has undergone a strategic shift and embraced the wide spectrum of asymmetrical synthetic methods now available. The use of these processes in developmental synthesis and large-scale manufacturing has provided new challenges in drug discovery, motivated by a desire to improve industrial efficacy and decrease the time from the conception of a new drug to the market.

    "abstract": "In summary, the search for a useful clinical laboratory diagnostic assay for the antiplatelet antibodies has been long and difficult. Measurement of platelet associated IgG (PAIgG) has been disappointing as a way to detect autoantibodies. This is primarily due to the fact that platelets normally contain IgG in their alpha granules in an amount that varies with plasma IgG levels and age of the platelets. Furthermore, the amounts of platelet associated IgG is affected by the presence of circulating immune complexes, platelet activation, and drug dependent antibodies. The newer, platelet antigen capture techniques are promising, but further testing will be needed to confirm their value to the clinician. Methods that allow incubation of patient serum or plasma with intact platelets (MAIPA and immunobead) have greater sensitivity than techniques in which the patient antibody is tested against previously isolated platelet glycoproteins. These assays are currently available in a only a limited number of platelet immunology laboratories. Platelet autoantibodies are directed against a number of glycoprotein antigens on the platelet surface. Most studies have shown that anti GPIIb/IIIa antibodies are the most common, although antibodies against GPIb/IX and other targets are frequently detected. Many patients have multiple antiplatelet antibodies circulating simultaneously. The clinical significance of antibodies with different specificity is under investigation. The precise epitopes on GPIIIa that bind antiplatelet autoantibodies have been studied to a limited extent. Some investigators report that the vast majority of platelet antigens are conformation dependent, being destroyed by treatment with EDTA (separation of GPIIb and GPIIIa) or denaturation with detergents. Others report sequence specific peptide antigens. Further investigation promises to better define the targets for platelet autoantibodies; improved clinical management of patients with ITP is the long term goal of these studies.",

In particular, it has never been shown that such alloantigens can be encoded by HLA-DP beta alleles. Indeed, matching for HLA-DP antigens is generally not considered to be of functional importance for the outcome of allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. In this study, a case of peripheral blood stem cell allograft rejection was investigated in which the patient and donor differed for a single mismatch at HLA-DP in the rejection direction. Patient-derived T lymphocytes circulating at the time of rejection showed direct ex vivo cytotoxic activity against donor-derived B-lymphoblastoid cells as well as other HLA-DP beta 1*0901--expressing targets. The presence of HLA-DP beta 1*0901--specific effectors in vivo was further confirmed by in vitro stimulation experiments. CD4(+) T-cell lines and clones with specific cytotoxic activity against HLA-DP beta 1*0901--expressing targets including donor B-lymphoblastoid cells were generated both by nonspecific and by donor-specific in vitro stimulation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that HLA-DP can be the target antigen of cytotoxic CD4(+) T lymphocytes involved in peripheral blood stem cell allograft rejection. (Blood. 2001;98:1122-1126)",

The first known human ABC transporter was P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which confers multidrug resistance (MDR) to anticancer drugs. In recent years, we have obtained an increased understanding of the mechanism of action of P-gp as its ATPase activity, substrate specificity and pharmacokinetic interactions have been investigated. This review focuses on the functional characterization of P-gp, as well as other ABC transporters involved in MDR: the family of multidrug-resistance-associated proteins (MRP1-7), and the recently discovered ABC half-transporter MXR (also known as BCRP, ABCP and ABCG2). We describe recent progress in the analysis of protein structure-function relationships, and consider the conceptual problem of defining and identifying substrates and inhibitors of MDR. An in-depth discussion follows of how coupling of nucleotide hydrolysis to substrate transport takes place, and we propose a scheme for the mechanism of P-gp function. Finally, the clinical correlations, both for reversal of MDR in cancer and for drug delivery, are discussed.",

Advances in the knowledge of molecular pathology of cancer make available strategies by which tumour cells can be profiled for their genetic background in order to select anticancer agents that might selectively kill cells in a molecular context that matches the mechanism of action of drugs. The next generation of anticancer treatments might thus be tailored on the basis of the numerous molecular alterations identified in tumour cells of a particular patient. However, to exploit these alterations, it is necessary to understand how they influence the cellular pathways that control the sensitivity or, conversely, resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. The aim of this article is to outline major genetic abnormalities in non-Hodgkin lymphomas that can be used to streamline anticancer drug selection and to underscore the major role of pharmacogenetics, which studies the interactions between genetic background and drug activity, to the prediction of likelihood of response and identification of potential new targets for pharmacological intervention.",

    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma remains an incurable disease, with median survival rates of 4-6 years even with aggressive, high-dose chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation, and intensive supportive care. Additionally, multiple myeloma is primarily a disease of the elderly, many of whom cannot tolerate aggressive chemotherapy. Thus, newer treatments with good safety profiles are needed to improve the quality of responses and, hopefully, to translate into prolonged progression and overall survival. The pathophysiology of multiple myeloma is complex, involving many pathways and interactions among cytokines, adhesion molecules, angiogenesis, and mechanisms of resistance, which, taken together, provide multiple targets for novel therapeutic modalities. Agents currently under investigation for treating multiple myeloma include thalidomide and its successors, PS-341, and arsenic trioxide. Thalidomide and immunomodulatory drugs both exhibit activity against multiple myeloma by affecting different levels of the immune system. PS-341 is a proteasome inhibitor that halts the cell cycle, resulting in apoptosis; it also inhibits a key transcription factor and may have antiangiogenic activity. Arsenic trioxide activates multicellular mechanisms to induce apoptosis, inhibit angiogenesis, and stimulate immune responses. Preclinical and early clinical data suggest that combination regimens should be pursued, given the different mechanisms of action of these compounds on the immune system and their non-overlapping toxicities at low dosages.",

    "abstract": "Higher plants and several photosynthetic algae contain the plastidic 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate/2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway (DOXP/MEP pathway) for isoprenoid biosynthesis. The first four enzymes and their genes are known of this novel pathway. All of the ca. 10 enzymes of this isoprenoid pathway are potential targets for new classes of herbicides. Since the DOXP/MEP pathway also occurs in several pathogenic bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, all inhibitors and potential herbicides of the DOXP/MEP pathway in plants are also potential drugs against pathogenic bacteria and the malaria parasite. Plants with their easily to handle DOXP/MEP-pathway are thus very suitable test-systems also for new drugs against pathogenic bacteria and the malaria parasite as no particular security measures are required. In fact, the antibiotic herbicide fosmidomycin specifically inhibited not only the DOXP reductoisomerase in plants, but also that in bacteria and in the parasite P. falciparum, and cures malaria-infected mice. This is the first successful application of a herbicide of the novel isoprenoid pathway as a possible drug against malaria.",

    "abstract": "The intraerythrocytic malarial parasite is involved in an extremely intensive anabolic activity while it resides in its metabolically quiescent host cell. The necessary fast uptake of nutrients and the discharge of waste product, are guaranteed by parasite-induced alterations of the constitutive transporters of the host cell and the production of new parallel pathways. The membrane of the host cell thus becomes permeable to phospholipids, purine bases and nucleosides, small non-electrolytes, anions and cations. When the new pathways are quantitatively unimportant, classical inhibitors of native transporters can be used to inhibit parasite growth. Several compounds were found to effectively inhibit the new pathways and consequently, parasite growth. The pathways have also been used to introduce cytotoxic agents. The parasitophorous membrane consists of channels which are highly permeable to small solutes and display no ion selectivity. Transport of some cations and anions across the parasite membrane is rapid and insensitive to classical inhibitors, and in some cases it is mediated by specific antiporters which respond to their respective inhibitors. Macromolecules have been shown to reach the parasitophorous space through a duct contiguous with the host cell membrane, and subsequently to be endocytosed at the parasite membrane. The simultaneous presence of the parasitophorous membrane channels and the duct, however, is incompatible with experimental evidences. No specific inhibitors were found as yet that would efficiently inhibit transport through the channels or the duct.",

    "title": "Autoimmune hepatitis after liver transplantation and other lessons of self-intolerance.",
    "abstract": "Autoimmune hepatitis has been described as recurrent or de novo disease after transplantation. The legitimacy of these diagnoses and the bases for their occurrence are unknown. To better understand these aspects of allograft dysfunction, the purported pathogenic mechanisms of classical autoimmune hepatitis were reviewed and extrapolated to recurrent and de novo disease after transplantation. Loss of self-tolerance may relate to defects in the negative selection of autoreactive immunocytes and the clonal expansion of promiscuous lymphocytes that are cross-reactive to homologous antigens (molecular mimicry). Repopulation of the allograft with recipient antigen-presenting cells and the presence of primed promiscuous cytotoxic T cells within the recipient are likely factors for recurrent disease. Targets may be the same peptides that triggered the original disease, donor-derived class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex, or homologous antigens associated with unidentified hepatotrophic viruses. De novo disease is probably due to similar mechanisms, but its predilection for children suggests that thymic dysfunction associated with cyclosporine treatment may be a factor. Corticosteroid therapy is effective in each condition. In conclusion, recurrent and de novo autoimmune hepatitis after transplantation are examples of self-intolerance. The mechanisms that perturb immunologic homeostasis in this human model of the classical disease must be studied more rigorously.",

    "abstract": "Insulin plays a major role in the regulation of skeletal muscle protein turnover but its mechanism of action is not fully understood, especially in vivo during catabolic states. These aspects are presently reviewed. Insulin inhibits the ATP-ubiquitin proteasome proteolytic pathway which is presumably the predominant pathway involved in the breakdown of muscle protein. Evidence of the ability of insulin to stimulate muscle protein synthesis in vivo was also presented. Many catabolic states in rats, e.g. streptozotocin diabetes, glucocorticoid excess or sepsis-induced cytokines, resulted in a decrease in insulin action on protein synthesis or degradation. The effect of catabolic factors would therefore be facilitated. In contrast, the antiproteolytic action of insulin was improved during hyperthyroidism in man and early lactation in goats. Excessive muscle protein breakdown should therefore be prevented. In other words, the anabolic hormone insulin partly controlled the 'catabolic drive'. Advances in the understanding of insulin signalling pathways and targets should provide information on the interactions between insulin action, muscle protein turnover and catabolic factors.",

    "title": "An overview of benzene metabolism.",
    "abstract": "Benzene toxicity involves both bone marrow depression and leukemogenesis caused by damage to multiple classes of hematopoietic cells and a variety of hematopoietic cell functions. Study of the relationship between the metabolism and toxicity of benzene indicates that several metabolites of benzene play significant roles in generating benzene toxicity. Benzene is metabolized, primarily in the liver, to a variety of hydroxylated and ring-opened products that are transported to the bone marrow where subsequent secondary metabolism occurs. Two potential mechanisms by which benzene metabolites may damage cellular macromolecules to induce toxicity include the covalent binding of reactive metabolites of benzene and the capacity of benzene metabolites to induce oxidative damage. Although the relative contributions of each of these mechanisms to toxicity remains unestablished, it is clear that different mechanisms contribute to the toxicities associated with different metabolites. As a corollary, it is unlikely that benzene toxicity can be described as the result of the interaction of a single metabolite with a single biological target. Continued investigation of the metabolism of benzene and its metabolites will allow us to determine the specific combination of metabolites as well as the biological target(s) involved in toxicity and will ultimately lead to our understanding of the relationship between the production of benzene metabolites and bone marrow toxicity.",

Epidemiological and family studies suggest a strong genetic component in the causation of this disease. Several genetically derived phenotypes in the population are responsible for variations in lipoprotein types, which in turn affect the amount of cholesterol available in the gall bladder. The genetic polymorphisms in various genes for apo E, apo B, apo A1, LDL receptor, cholesteryl ester transfer and LDL receptor-associated protein have been implicated in gallstone formation. However, presently available information on genetic differences is not able to account for a large number of gallstone patients. The molecular studies in the animal models have not only confirmed the present paradigm of gallstone formation but also helped in identification of novel genes in humans, which might play an important role in pathogenesis of the disease. Precise understanding of such genes and their molecular mechanisms may provide the basis of new targets for rational drug designs and dietary interventions.",

The complex specific effects of lipid hormones depend not only on receptor expression, distribution and interactions, but also on the availability and metabolic conversion of the hormone itself. The cell-specific metabolic activation of inactive hormone precursors introduces a further level of hormonal regulation, and constitutes an important concept in endocrinology. The metabolic reactions carried out are achieved by dehydrogenases/reductases, hydroxylases and other enzymes, acting on ligands of the steroid/thyroid/retinoic hormone receptor superfamily. The concept implies that these tissue- and cell-specific metabolic conversions contribute to lipid hormone action, thus pointing to novel targets in drug development. All components of this signalling system, the hormone compounds, the receptor proteins, and modifying enzyme families originate from an early metazoan date, emphasizing the essential nature of all elements for development and diversification of vertebrate life.",

The question is an important one because synchronization will increase postsynaptic efficacy at subsequent projection targets. We simultaneously recorded local potentials (LPs) from the globus pallidus interna (GPi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) in four awake patients after neurosurgery for Parkinson's disease. Nuclei from both sides were recorded in two patients so that a total of six ipsilateral GPi-STN LP recordings were made. Without medication, the power within and the coherence between the GPi and STN was dominated by activity with a frequency <30 Hz. Treatment with the dopamine precursor levodopa reduced the low-frequency activity and resulted in a new peak at approximately 70 Hz. This was evident in the power spectrum from STN and GPi and in the coherence between these nuclei. The phase relationship between the nuclei varied in a complex manner according to frequency band and the presence of exogenous dopaminergic stimulation. Synchronization of activity does occur between pallidum and STN, and its pattern is critically dependent on the level of dopaminergic activity.",

    "abstract": "Viruses of the family Herpesviridae are responsible for a diverse set of human diseases. The available treatments are largely ineffective, with the exception of a few drugs for treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. For several members of this DNA virus family, advances have been made recently in the biochemistry and structural biology of the essential viral protease, revealing common features that may be possible to exploit in the development of a new class of anti-herpesvirus agents. The herpesvirus proteases have been identified as belonging to a unique class of serine protease, with a Ser-His-His catalytic triad. A new, single domain protein fold has been determined by X-ray crystallography for the proteases of at least three different herpesviruses. Also unique for serine proteases, dimerization has been shown to be required for activity of the cytomegalovirus and HSV proteases. The dimerization requirement seriously impacts methods needed for productive, functional analysis and inhibitor discovery. The conserved functional and catalytic properties of the herpesvirus proteases lead to common considerations for this group of proteases in the early phases of inhibitor discovery. In general, classical serine protease inhibitors that react with active site residues do not readily inactivate the herpesvirus proteases. There has been progress however, with activated carbonyls that exploit the selective nucleophilicity of the active site serine. In addition, screening of chemical libraries has yielded novel structures as starting points for drug development. Recent crystal structures of the herpesvirus proteases now allow more direct interpretation of ligand structure-activity relationships. This review first describes basic functional aspects of herpesvirus protease biology and enzymology. Then we discuss inhibitors identified to date and the prospects for their future development.",

    "title": "Alpha-toxin of Staphylococcus aureus.",
    "abstract": "Alpha-toxin, the major cytotoxic agent elaborated by Staphylococcus aureus, was the first bacterial exotoxin to be identified as a pore former. The protein is secreted as a single-chain, water-soluble molecule of Mr 33,000. At low concentrations (less than 100 nM), the toxin binds to as yet unidentified, high-affinity acceptor sites that have been detected on a variety of cells including rabbit erythrocytes, human platelets, monocytes and endothelial cells. At high concentrations, the toxin additionally binds via nonspecific absorption to lipid bilayers; it can thus damage both cells lacking significant numbers of the acceptor and protein-free artificial lipid bilayers. Membrane damage occurs in both cases after membrane-bound toxin molecules collide via lateral diffusion to form ring-structured hexamers. The latter insert spontaneously into the lipid bilayer to form discrete transmembrane pores of effective diameter 1 to 2 nm. A hypothetical model is advanced in which the pore is lined by amphiphilic beta-sheets, one surface of which interacts with lipids whereas the other repels apolar membrane constitutents to force open an aqueous passage. The detrimental effects of alpha-toxin are due not only to the death of susceptible targets, but also to the presence of secondary cellular reactions that can be triggered via Ca2+ influx through the pores. Well-studied phenomena include the stimulation of arachidonic acid metabolism, triggering of granule exocytosis, and contractile dysfunction. Such processes cause profound long-range disturbances such as development of pulmonary edema and promotion of blood coagulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "As we emerge into the post-genome era, proteomics finds itself as the driving force field as we translate the nucleic acid information archive into understanding how the cell actually works and how disease processes operate. Even so, the traditionally held view of proteomics as simply cataloging and developing lists of the cellular protein repertoire of a cell are now changing, especially in the sub-discipline of clinical proteomics. The most relevant information archive to clinical applications and drug development involves the elucidation of the information flow of the cell; the \"software\" of protein pathway networks and circuitry. The deranged circuitry of the cell as the drug target itself as well as the effect of the drug on not just the target, but also the entire network, is what we now are striving towards. Clinical proteomics, as a new and most exciting sub-discipline of proteomics, involves the bench-to-bedside clinical application of proteomic tools. Unlike the genome, there are potentially thousands of proteomes: each cell type has its own unique proteome. Moreover, each cell type can alter its proteome depending on the unique tissue microenvironment in which it resides, giving rise to multiple permutations of a single proteome. Since there is no polymerase chain reaction equivalent to proteomics- identifying and discovering the \"wiring diagram\" of a human diseased cell in a biopsy specimen remains a daunting challenge. New micro-proteomic technologies are being and still need to be developed to drill down into the proteomes of clinically relevant material. Cancer, as a model disease, provides a fertile environment to study the application of proteomics at the bedside. The promise of clinical proteomics and the new technologies that are developed is that we will detect cancer earlier through discovery of biomarkers, we will discover the next generation of targets and imaging biomarkers, and we can then apply this knowledge to patient-tailored therapy.",

SDS had only modest effects on Tm* [1% (w/v) equating to 8 mM NaCl]. RNA/DNA hybrids were approximately 11 degrees C more stable than DNA/DNA hybrids. Incomplete homology (69%) significantly reduced the Tm* for DNA/DNA hybrids (approximately /4degrees C; 0.45 degrees C/% nonhomology) but far less so for RNA/DNA hybrids (approximately 2.3 degrees C; approximately 0.07 degrees C/% non-homology); incomplete homology also markedly reduced the extent of hybridization.

It has been widely believed that O-glycosylation is the major carbohydrate modification in the intraerythrocytic stage of P. falciparum and that the parasite has no N-glycosylation capacity. Contrary to this, recent studies have demonstrated that P. falciparum has a low N-glycosylation capability, and O-glycosylation is either absent or present at an extremely low level, whereas glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor modification is common and is the major carbohydrate modification in parasite proteins. The GPI anchor moieties are essential for parasite survival. The parasite GPI anchors can activate signaling pathways in host cells, and thereby induce the expression of inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules and induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). This might cause erythrocyte sequestration, hypoglycemia, triglyceride lipogenesis and immune dysregulation. Thus, the parasite GPI anchor structure and biosynthetic pathways are attractive targets for antimalarial and/or antiparasite drug development, as discussed here by Channe Gowda and Eugene Davidson.",

    "title": "Polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arthritis.",
    "abstract": "Polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis are closely related inflammatory conditions that affect different cellular targets in genetically predisposed persons. Compared with temporal arteritis, polymyalgla rheumatica is much more common, affecting one in 200 persons older than 50 years. Temporal arteritis, however, is more dangerous and can lead to sudden blindness. The diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica is based on the presence of a clinical syndrome consisting of fever, nonspecific somatic complaints, pain and stiffness in the shoulder and pelvic girdles, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Temporal arteritis typically presents with many of the same findings as polymyalgia rheumatica, but patients also have headaches and tenderness to palpation over the involved artery. Arterial biopsy usually confirms the diagnosis of temporal arteritis. Early diagnosis and treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis can dramatically improve patients' lives and return them to previous functional status. Corticosteroid therapy provides rapid and dramatic improvement of the clinical features of both conditions. Therapy is generally continued for six to 24 months. Throughout treatment, clinical condition is assessed periodically. Patients are instructed to see their physician immediately if symptoms recur or they develop new headache, jaw claudication or visual problems.",

    "abstract": "This review is a collection of abstracts of seven papers presented at the panel discussion Issues in the Development of Drugs for Treating Deep-Seated Mycosis - From Drug Discovery to Clinical Studies held at the 45th Annual Meeting of the Japanese Society of Medical Mycology. The first three presentations concerned the discovery of new drugs. The first discussed the screening, analysis of chemical structure and elucidation of the mechanism of action of new antifungal agents focusing on aureobasidin A. The second was on the search for and development of novel agents with selective targets of action, specifically FK463 (micafungin) which inhibits (1-3)-beta-glucan synthase. The third described the development of novel derivatives based on the structure-activity correlation of triazole agents, with CS-758 as an example. The remaining four presentations discussed the status and issues of clinical studies targeting hematological disorders and respiratory diseases, as well as various problems from the company point of view on new drug development and those from the government side concerning the approval of new drugs. This type of meeting which provides an opportunity for discussion of various multi-faceted issues from the discovery of a new drug to its preclinical and clinical studies can contribute greatly to progress in the future development of new antifungal agents.",

    "title": "For the clinical application of thermochemotherapy given at mild temperatures.",
    "abstract": "It has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that hyperthermia can enhance the cytotoxicity of some chemotherapeutic agents. This paper summarizes the authors' own laboratory studies on the effect of chemotherapeutic agents given at elevated temperatures, experimental results obtained using animal tumour systems in other laboratories, and clinical trials of thermochemotherapy reported in literature. The in vivo studies have demonstrated that the thermal enhancement of cytotoxicity of many chemotherapeutic agents is maximized at mild temperatures such as at 40.5-43 degrees C. Comparison of in vitro and in vivo results using five agents show that the in vivo thermal enhancement increases with an increase in the activation energy obtained in the temperature range between 40.5 and 43.0 degrees C. A summary of experimental results obtained by various investigators indicates a potentially wide variation in the thermal enhancement of a given agent among the different types of tumours and suggests potential agents useful at moderately elevated temperatures. In vivo studies on nine different agents indicate that the drug(s) of choice at physiological temperatures may not be the drug(s) of choice at elevated temperatures. It is also shown that drug concentration in the target must be high for sufficient thermal enhancement. Clinical trials of thermochemotherapy have employed various heating methods, including local heating, hyerthermic perfusion and whole body hyperthermia. Extensive trials have been made in the treatment of melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma in the extremity. Hyperthermic isolated perfusion with chemotherapeutic(s) provides much higher drug concentration than a systemic drug administration in the target(s), resulting in a high tumour response rate and an increased survival of the patients. It is of interest that the most successful agent used in the treatment of both melanomas and sarcomas is melphalan and is the drug of choice at moderately elevated temperatures among the nine agents tested in the in vivo studies. Current results using the tumour necrosis factor with melphalan are impressive. In several institutes, techniques have been developed to uniformly heat the localized tumour, but studies are needed to find an agent effective at elevated temperatures to each type of tumours and to establish the methods for obtaining a sufficient drug concentration in the target tissue.",

    "title": "Sequence-specific interactions of drugs interfering with the topoisomerase-DNA cleavage complex.",
    "abstract": "DNA-processing enzymes, such as the topoisomerases (tops), represent major targets for potent anticancer (and antibacterial) agents. The drugs kill cells by poisoning the enzymes' catalytic cycle. Understanding the molecular details of top poisoning is a fundamental requisite for the rational development of novel, more effective antineoplastic drugs. In this connection, sequence-specific recognition of the top-DNA complex is a key step to preferentially direct the action of the drugs onto selected genomic sequences. In fact, the (reversible) interference of drugs with the top-DNA complex exhibits well-defined preferences for DNA bases in the proximity of the cleavage site, each drug showing peculiarities connected to its structural features. A second level of selectivity can be observed when chemically reactive groups are present in the structure of the top-directed drug. In this case, the enzyme recognizes or generates a unique site for covalent drug-DNA binding. This will further subtly modulate the drug's efficiency in stimulating DNA damage at selected sites. Finally, drugs can discriminate not only among different types of tops, but also among different isoenzymes, providing an additional level of specific selection. Once the molecular basis for DNA sequence-dependent recognition has been established, the above-mentioned modes to generate selectivity in drug poisoning can be rationally exploited, alone or in combination, to develop tailor-made drugs targeted at defined loci in cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Drugs and environmental chemicals can adversely affect the reproductive system. Currently, available data indicate that the consequences of exposure depend on the nature of the chemical, its target, and the timing of exposure relative to critical windows in development of the reproductive system. The reproductive system is designed to produce gametes in far greater excess than would seem to be necessary for the survival of species. Ten to hundreds of millions of spermatozoa are generated daily by most adult male mammals, yet very few of these germ cells succeed in transmitting their genetic material to the next generation. Although the number of oocytes produced in mammalian females is more limited, and their production occurs only during fetal life, most ovaries contain several orders of magnitude more oocytes than ever will be fertilized. Toxicant exposures may affect critical events in the development of the reproductive system, ranging from early primordial germ cell determination to gonadal differentiation, gametogenesis, external genitalia, or signaling events regulating sexual behavior. Although there are differences between the human reproductive system and that of the usual animal models, such models have been extremely useful in assessing risks for key human reproductive and developmental processes. The objectives for future studies should include the elucidation of the specific cellular and molecular targets of known toxicants; the design of a systematic approach to the identification of reproductive toxicants; and the development of sensitive, specific, and predictive animal models, minimally invasive surrogate markers, or in vitro tests to assess reproductive system function during embryonic, postnatal, and adult life.",

    "title": "Pharmacologic insights into the future of trastuzumab.",
    "abstract": "A combination of factors has been responsible for improvements in cancer survival and cure rates. In addition to new therapies with novel/genetic targets, these include improvements in drug delivery, new schedules/sequencing of drug administration and the identification of combination therapies with greater activity/dose density than existing regimens. The recognition that such criteria can affect treatment outcome has led to their incorporation into clinical trials of new drugs. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters have become increasingly important for the rational selection of dose, administration route and schedule. The humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) has been rationally developed to target the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), which is overexpressed in 20%-30% of breast cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. Trastuzumab when administered i.v. on a weekly schedule either alone or in combination with taxanes, improves survival of women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Based upon pharmacokinetic considerations, current studies are examining whether trastuzumab can be administered i.v. every three weeks or by the s.c. route. These regimens would have advantages for patients and medical staff in terms of acceptability, ease of administration and, potentially, cost effectiveness. Furthermore, various combinations of trastuzumab and chemotherapeutic agents are being explored with the aim of identifying the optimal combination regimen for clinical use. The rationale for these various studies and the studies themselves are described.",

    "abstract": "Immunological tolerance represents a mechanism by which cells of the host remain protected from the immune system. Breaking of immunological tolerance can result in a variety of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. The reasons for tolerance breaking down and autoimmune processes arising are largely unknown but of obvious interest for therapeutic intervention of these diseases. Although reversal of the tolerant state is generally unwanted, there are instances where this may be of benefit to the host. In particular, one way a cancerous cell escapes being targeted by the immune system is through tolerance mechanisms that in effect turn off the reactivity of T lymphocytes that can respond to tumor-associated peptides. Thus tolerance represents a major obstacle in developing effective immunotherapy against tumors. The molecules that are involved in regulating immunological tolerance are then of interest as they may be great targets for positively or negatively manipulating the tolerance process.",

    "title": "Rationale for treating epilepsy in children.",
    "abstract": "Growing evidence indicates that the effects of antiepileptic drugs on childhood epilepsies are partly linked to the specific type of epilepsy or epilepsy syndrome. Most (but not all) types of epilepsy can be classified into categories that are conceptually meaningful. It is likewise logical to set treatment targets and to estimate the risks according to the main syndromic groups, as they share common, electroclinical presentations and long-term prognosis. Treatment should then be adjusted to each patient's clinical characteristics. Treatment should be started soon, whenever there is indication that delay would harm the child. However, if seizures are not disabling, treatment may be delayed, in order to acquire more knowledge about the spontaneous expression of the disorder and the plan thoughtfully explained to the parents. In children presenting with partial symptomatic or cryptogenic epilepsy, it is important to assess the patient's response to several different drugs. However, in patients regarded as having refractory epilepsy, possibilities for a surgical solution must be evaluated early in the course of the disease. In severe epileptic encephalopathies, complete seizure control is impossible and, ideally, treatment should provide as much integration and autonomy, with alleviation of frequent seizures. Again, this should be carefully explained to the parents. In children with severe epileptiform EEG abnormalities coexisting with brain dysfunction (diffuse or specific), the extent of EEG-related neurological dysfunction should be determined, and vigorous treatment should be started to abate its effects. Finally, seizures could be worsened by inappropriate drugs, paradoxical reaction or intoxication. Severe childhood epilepsies are particularly at risk and mild idiopathic epilepsies may be transformed into severe disorders, priming a vicious circle of heavy treatment, whereby the original disorder is no longer recognizable.",

    "abstract": "Cyclosporin A, the major immunosuppressive drug in transplantation, and the more potent therapeutic drug candidate, FK506, have led to the discovery of two superfamilies of immunosuppressant binding proteins, the cyclophilins and the FK binding proteins. These proteins, enzymes with high kcat values for isomerization of X-Pro bonds in peptides and protein substrates, are distributed in all cell compartments where protein folding normally occurs. It is likely that they play major roles in the protein folding and protein trafficking in the cell. It is also likely that they have been suborned in T cells by the immunosuppressant drugs that are potent pseudosubstrate ligands that selectively block the signal transduction cascade. The discovery of the inhibition of protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin) by the drug-immunophilin complex (CsA-CyP or FK506-FKBP) provides evidence for a specific downstream target of the drug-immunophilin complexes and may prompt a search for endogenous ligands of cyclophilin and FKBP that may effect signal transduction regulation. The molecular insights gained over a short time in this area have been remarkable; they promise to elucidate the steps in T cell activation and delineate new targets for immunosuppressive therapy.",

In this review we will analyze the steps involved in tumor metastases, which can be potential targets for anti-metastatic therapy. One of the most critical events in cancer metastasis is the invasion of basement membranes. An assay which we developed over ten years ago, the matrigel \"chemoinvasion\" assay, has been a useful tool for studying the mechanisms involved in tumor and endothelial cell invasion of basement membranes and for the screening of anti-invasive agents.

The introduction of biophysical techniques with high temporal and spatial resolution, and the identification of Ca(2+)-dependent and -independent \"docking\" and \"fusion\" proteins, has greatly enhanced our understanding of exocytosis. The cloning of families of ion channel proteins, including intracellular ion channels, has also revived interest in the role of secretory granule ion channels in exocytotic secretion. Thus secretory granules of pancreatic acinar cell express a ClC-2 Cl(-) channel, a HCO-permeable member of the CLCA Ca(2+)-dependent anion channel family, and a KCNQ1 K(+) channel. Evidence suggests that these channels may facilitate the release of digestive enzymes and/or prevent exocytosed granules from collapsing during \"kiss and run\" recycling. In pancreatic beta-cells, a granular ClC-3 Cl(-) channel provides a shunt pathway for a vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase. Acidification \"primes\" the granules for Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis and release of insulin. In summary, secretory granules are equipped with specific sets of ion channels, which modulate regulated exocytosis and the release of macromolecules. These channels could represent excellent targets for therapeutic interventions to control exocytotic secretion in relevant diseases, such as pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, or diabetes mellitus.",

Although each HOX gene product exhibits in vivo specificity, they harbor very similar DNA-binding affinities in vitro, suggesting that other mechanisms such as protein-protein interactions are critical to modulate their function. In this commentary, we describe the proteins that can interact with the HOX gene products, including newly identified partners such as CREB binding protein and the NF-kappaB/IkappaB-alpha proteins.

    "title": "The role of CD8+ T cells during allograft rejection.",
    "abstract": "Organ transplantation can be considered as replacement therapy for patients with end-stage organ failure. The percent of one-year allograft survival has increased due, among other factors, to a better understanding of the rejection process and new immunosuppressive drugs. Immunosuppressive therapy used in transplantation prevents activation and proliferation of alloreactive T lymphocytes, although not fully preventing chronic rejection. Recognition by recipient T cells of alloantigens expressed by donor tissues initiates immune destruction of allogeneic transplants. However, there is controversy concerning the relative contribution of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to allograft rejection. Some animal models indicate that there is an absolute requirement for CD4+ T cells in allogeneic rejection, whereas in others CD4-depleted mice reject certain types of allografts. Moreover, there is evidence that CD8+ T cells are more resistant to immunotherapy and tolerance induction protocols. An intense focal infiltration of mainly CD8+CTLA4+ T lymphocytes during kidney rejection has been described in patients. This suggests that CD8+ T cells could escape from immunosuppression and participate in the rejection process. Our group is primarily interested in the immune mechanisms involved in allograft rejection. Thus, we believe that a better understanding of the role of CD8+ T cells in allograft rejection could indicate new targets for immunotherapy in transplantation. Therefore, the objective of the present review was to focus on the role of the CD8+ T cell population in the rejection of allogeneic tissue.",

    "title": "Preferential targeting of apoptosis in tumor versus normal cells.",
    "abstract": "Elimination of cancer cells by early apoptosis is preferred over other forms of cell growth inhibition. Apoptosis directly leads to tumor regression and reduces risks of selecting more aggressive and/or drug-resistant phenotypes that are often responsible for tumor regrowth and treatment failure. Although DNA damage by anticancer drugs is commonly recognized as an apoptotic stimulus, there is enormous variability in the magnitude and timing of such effects. Especially potent and rapid apoptosis seems to be a hallmark of various alkylating anticancer drugs that are regarded as DNA-reactive agents but are observed to react mainly with cellular proteins. Our studies with such dual-action drugs (irofulven, oxaliplatin) suggest that not only DNA damage, but also protein damage, contributes to apoptosis induction. DNA damage is well known to initiate death-signaling pathways leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Protein damage, in turn, can distort cell redox homeostasis, which facilitates apoptosis execution. Such dual effects can be particularly lethal to tumor cells, which tend to function under pro-oxidative conditions. In contrast to tumor cells that are highly susceptible, normal cells show marginal apoptotic responses to the dual action drugs. This protection of normal cells might reflect their greater ability to buffer pro-oxidative changes and quickly restore redox homeostasis, despite substantial drug uptake and macromolecular binding. Importantly, by targeting the death process at multiple points, DNA- and protein-damaging drugs can be less vulnerable to various bypass mechanisms possible with single targets. The reviewed studies provide a proof of concept that differential apoptosis targeting in cancer versus normal cells can be a basis for tumor selectivity of anticancer drugs.",

Bull World Health Organ. 2000;78(2):222-3.As more and more infectious agents become targets for immunization programmes, the spectrum of adverse events linked to vaccines has been widening. Although some of these links are tenuous, relatively little is known about the immunopathogenesis of even the best characterized vaccine-associated adverse events (VAAEs). The range of possible use of active immunization is rapidly expanding to include vaccines against infectious diseases that require cellular responses to provide protection (e.g. tuberculosis, herpes viral infections), therapeutic vaccines for chronic infections (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, viral hepatitis B and C), and vaccines against non-infectious conditions (e.g. cancer, autoimmune diseases). Less virulent pathogens (e.g. varicella, rotavirus in the developed world) are also beginning to be targeted, and vaccine use is being justified in terms of societal and parental \"costs\" rather than in straightforward morbidity and mortality costs. In the developed world the paediatric immunization schedule is becoming crowded, with pressure to administer increasing numbers of antigens simultaneously in ever simpler forms (e.g. subcomponent, peptide, and DNA vaccines). This trend, while attractive in many ways, brings hypothetical risks (e.g. genetic restriction, narrowed shield of protection, and loss of randomness), which will need to be evaluated and monitored. The available epidemiological and laboratory tools to address the issues outlined above are somewhat limited. As immunological and genetic tools improve in the years ahead, it is likely that we shall be able to explain the immunopathogenesis of many VAAEs and perhaps even anticipate and avoid some of them. However, this will only happen if the human and financial resources needed for monitoring and studying vaccine safety stay in step with the accelerating pace of vaccine development. Failure to make such a commitment would put all immunization programmes at risk.",

    "title": "Understanding the human health effects of chemical mixtures.",
    "abstract": "Most research on the effects of chemicals on biologic systems is conducted on one chemical at a time. However, in the real world people are exposed to mixtures, not single chemicals. Although various substances may have totally independent actions, in many cases two substances may act at the same site in ways that can be either additive or nonadditive. Many even more complex interactions may occur if two chemicals act at different but related targets. In the extreme case there may be synergistic effects, in which case the effects of two substances together are greater than the sum of either effect alone. In reality, most persons are exposed to many chemicals, not just one or two, and therefore the effects of a chemical mixture are extremely complex and may differ for each mixture depending on the chemical composition. This complexity is a major reason why mixtures have not been well studied. In this review we attempt to illustrate some of the principles and approaches that can be used to study effects of mixtures. By the nature of the state of the science, this discussion is more a presentation of what we do not know than of what we do know about mixtures. We approach the study of mixtures at three levels, using specific examples. First, we discuss several human diseases in relation to a variety of environmental agents believed to influence the development and progression of the disease. We present results of selected cellular and animal studies in which simple mixtures have been investigated. Finally, we discuss some of the effects of mixtures at a molecular level.",

    "abstract": "The hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3), the active form of vitamin D3, is an important regulator of calcium homeostasis, exerts antiproliferative effects on various cell systems and can induce differentiation in some kinds of hematopoietic cells. These effects are triggered by its receptor, vitamin D receptor (VDR), a phosphoprotein member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, which functions as a transcriptional factor. VDR binds as a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor (R X R) to hexameric repeats, characterized as vitamin D-responsive elements present in the regulatory region of target genes such as osteocalcin, osteopontin, calbindin-D28K, calbindin-D9K, p21WAF1/CIP1, TGF-beta2 and vitamin D 24-hydroxylase. Many factors such as glucocorticoids, estrogens, retinoids, proliferation rate and cell transformation can modulate VDR levels. VDR is expressed in mammary tissue and breast cancer cells, which are potential targets to hormone action. Besides having antiproliferative properties, vitamin D might also reduce the invasiveness of cancer cells and act as an anti-angiogenesis agent. All of these antitumoral features suggest that the properties of vitamin D could be explored for chemopreventive and therapeutic purposes in cancer. However, hypercalcemia is an undesirable side effect associated with pharmacological doses of 1,25-(OH)2D3. Some promising 1,25-(OH)2D3 analogs have been developed, which are less hypercalcemic in spite of being potent antiproliferative agents. They represent a new field of investigation.",

    "title": "Impact of oxidative stress on signal transduction control by phosphotyrosine phosphatases.",
    "abstract": "Phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) serve as important regulators of cellular signal transduction pathways. PTPs are sensitive targets of oxidative stress and may be inhibited by treatments that induce intracellular oxidation. The effects of PTP inactivation under oxidizing conditions are amplified by the redox-linked activation of key protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), thus leading to the initiation of phosphotyrosine-signaling cascades that are no longer under normal receptor control. These ligand-independent signals result in the accumulation of protein phosphotyrosine, the generation of second messengers, the activation of downstream kinases, and the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). In this review we consider the relative contribution of oxidative stress to the effects of PTP inhibition by vanadium-based compounds in lymphocytes. Although the inactivation of PTPs can lead to NF-kappa B mobilization in the presence of antioxidants, the other effects noted appear to require a threshold of intracellular oxidation. The combined effects of oxidative stress on signal transduction cascades reflect a synergy between the initiation of signals by PTKs and the loss of control by PTPs. This suggests a mechanism by which environmental agents that cause oxidative stress may alter the course of cellular responses through induction or enhancement of signaling cascades leading to functional changes or cell death.",

    "abstract": "There are 16 approved human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) drugs belonging to three mechanistic classes: protease inhibitors, nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors, and nonnucleoside RT inhibitors. HIV-1 resistance to these drugs is caused by mutations in the protease and RT enzymes, the molecular targets of these drugs. Drug resistance mutations arise most often in treated individuals, resulting from selective drug pressure in the presence of incompletely suppressed virus replication. HIV-1 isolates with drug resistance mutations, however, may also be transmitted to newly infected individuals. Three expert panels have recommended that HIV-1 protease and RT susceptibility testing should be used to help select HIV drug therapy. Although genotypic testing is more complex than typical antimicrobial susceptibility tests, there is a rich literature supporting the prognostic value of HIV-1 protease and RT mutations. This review describes the genetic mechanisms of HIV-1 drug resistance and summarizes published data linking individual RT and protease mutations to in vitro and in vivo resistance to the currently available HIV drugs.",

    "abstract": "In the past years, the attention of scientists has focused mainly on the study of the genetic information and alterations that regulate eukaryotic cell proliferation and that lead to neoplastic transformation. All therapeutic strategies against cancer are, to date, directed at DNA either with cytotoxic drugs or gene therapy. Little or no interest has been aroused by protein synthesis mechanisms. However, an increasing body of data is emerging about the involvement of translational processes and factors in control of cell proliferation, indicating that protein synthesis can be an additional target for anticancer strategies. In this paper we review the novel insights on the biochemical and molecular events leading to protein biosynthesis and we describe their involvement in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. A possible mechanistic explanation is given by the interactions that occur between protein synthesis machinery and the proliferative signal transduction pathways and that are therefore suitable targets for indirect modulation of protein synthesis. We briefly describe the molecular tools used to block protein synthesis and the attempts made at increasing their efficacy. Finally, we propose a new multimodal strategy against cancer based on the simultaneous intervention on protein synthesis and signal transduction.",

    "abstract": "This article will review the pertinent data on the use of chemotherapy for all stages of pancreatic cancer. For patients with metastatic disease, fluorouracil (5-FU) was the standard of care for several decades until a single randomized trial established that gemcitabine (Gemzar) produced a greater clinical benefit response, median survival, and 1-year survival. Among the currently available chemotherapy agents, the taxanes, fluoropyrimidines, and camptothecins are being evaluated in clinical trials alone or in combination with gemcitabine. Newer agents that are not classically cytotoxic are also under investigation and hold promise for the future. In patients with locally advanced unresectable disease, chemotherapy is commonly used to sensitize the cancer to radiation. Current investigations focus on trying to improve chemotherapy as a radiation sensitizer, using, for example, infusional 5-FU and gemcitabine. Early-stage, surgically resectable patients may benefit from the combination of chemotherapy and radiation, although more recent trials conducted in Europe raise some doubt. However, flaws in trial design do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn about the benefits of adjuvant therapy. Both chemotherapy and chemoradiation are under further investigation. Significant improvements in the survival of patients with pancreatic cancer will be achieved as more effective systemic therapies are developed, including agents with novel cellular targets.",

There is some evidence to suggest that the incidence of ectasia is increasing, and therefore understanding of this entity needs to improve. This article reviews the current literature on coronary artery ectasia and summarizes the findings. A treatment plan that targets each of the suggested clinical complications is provided. Using multiple indirect observations and current understanding of endothelium-derived relaxation factor, a possible etiology that implicates overstimulation of endogenous nitric oxide is provided. Current literature suggests that ectatic coronary arteries, even without the presence of coronary stenosis, are subject to thrombus formation, vasospasm, and spontaneous dissection. Newer subgroups of ectasia are arising with the use of multiple interventional devices to dilate coronary artery stenosis. By design, these destroy the media of the coronary artery, and it is not clear whether these \"iatrogenic\" ectatic arteries are subject to the same complications as \"idiopathic\" coronary artery ectasia. Further investigation is necessary to help define the benefit of the proposed treatment regimen, to clarify the prognosis of these newer groups of \"iatrogenic\" ectasia, and to confirm or disprove the hypothesis targeting nitric oxide as an etiologic factor.",

    "abstract": "The search for new methods of treating cancer, combined with advances in our understanding of carcinogenesis, molecular biology and technology, has resulted in the development of novel biologic agents with proven clinical efficacy. One such agent is trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). HER2 is a member of a family of receptors that interact with each other and various ligands to stimulate various intracellular signal transduction pathways involved in cell growth control. HER2 is overexpressed in 20%-30% of women with breast cancer and is associated with aggressive tumor characteristics and poor prognosis. Trastuzumab is the first humanized monoclonal antibody to be approved for therapeutic use and the first oncogene-targeted treatment with proven survival benefit in women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. However, its mechanism of action has not been fully characterized and appears to be complex. This paper reviews current knowledge of the mechanism of action of trastuzumab, including HER2 protein downregulation, prevention of HER2-containing heterodimer formation, initiation of G1 arrest and induction of p27, prevention of HER2 cleavage, inhibition of angiogenesis, and induction of immune mechanisms. The significance of these mechanisms for selection of concomitant chemotherapy is also considered.",

    "abstract": "A dense network of extrinsic and intrinsic sensory neurons supplies the gastrointestinal tract. Intrinsic sensory neurons provide the enteric nervous system with the kind of information that this brain of the gut requires for its autonomic control of digestion, whereas extrinsic afferents notify the brain about processes that are relevant to energy and fluid homeostasis and the sensation of discomfort and pain. The sensory repertoire of afferent neurons is extended by their responsiveness to mediators released from enteroendocrine and immune cells, which act like \"taste buds\" of the gut and serve as interface between the gastrointestinal lumen and the sensory nerve terminals in the lamina propria of the mucosa. Functional bowel disorders such as non-ulcer dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome are characterized by abdominal discomfort or pain in the absence of an identifiable organic cause. It is hypothesized with good reason that infection, inflammation or trauma causes sensory pathways to undergo profound phenotypic and functional alterations that outlast the acute insult. The pertinent changes involve an exaggerated sensitivity of the peripheral afferent nerve fibres as well as a distorted processing and representation of the incoming information in the brain. This concept identifies a number of receptors and ion channels that are selectively expressed by primary afferent neurons as important molecular targets at which to aim novel therapies for functional bowel disorders.",

    "title": "New immunological approaches and cytokine targets in asthma and allergy.",
    "abstract": "The aims of current asthma treatment are to suppress airway inflammation and control symptoms, and corticosteroids maintain a commanding position in this role. Steroids effectively suppress inflammation in the majority of patients but have little impact on the natural history of this disease. In severe asthmatics, corticosteroids may have relatively less beneficial effects. Recent advances in understanding the inflammatory and immunological mechanisms of asthma have indicated many potential therapeutic avenues that may prevent or reverse abnormalities that underlie asthma. As the roles of effector cells, and of signalling and adhesion molecules are better understood, the opportunities to inhibit or prevent the inflammatory cascade have increased. In addition, there have been advances in the synthesis of proteins, monoclonal antibodies and new small molecule chemical entities, which may provide valuable flexibility in the therapeutic approach to asthma. The novel immunological approaches include the prevention of T-cell activation, attempts to influence the balance of T-helper cell (Th) populations to inhibit or prevent Th2-derived cytokine expression, and the inhibition or blockade of the downstream actions of these cytokines such as effects on immunoglobulin-E and eosinophils. These approaches provide broad as well as highly specific targeting, and also prospects for prevention and reversal of immunological and inflammatory abnormalities associated with asthma. Hopefully, the development of effective antiasthma agents with effects beyond those provided by current therapies coupled with lesser side-effects will further address the unmet needs of asthma.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of progressive decline of cognitive function in aged humans, and it is characterized by the presence of numerous senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles accompanied by neuronal loss. The senile plaques are composed of amyloid beta-peptides (A beta), 40-42 amino acid peptide fragments of the beta-amyloid precursor protein. Genetic, molecular biological and neuropharmacological evidence support the 'amyloid cascade hypothesis' for the pathogenesis of the disease. We review the in vivo effects of various compounds on behavioral and neuropathological changes in the non-transgenic animal models of AD produced by continuous i.c.v. infusion of A beta. These results support therapeutic strategies such as cholinergic therapy, anti-inflammatory agents, antioxidants and estrogen replacement therapy, as well as other cognition enhancers for the treatment of AD. In addition, the amyloid cascade hypothesis offers a number of potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies in AD. We believe that our non-transgenic animal model, as well as transgenic animal models, are useful for developing novel pharmacotherapeutics in AD.",

    "abstract": "Phophodiesterase (PDE) isoenzyme profiles of human cell preparations and tissues have been analysed by a semiquantitative method using selective PDE inhibitors and activators. Neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes contain PDE IV exclusively. Lymphocytes, alveolar macrophages and endothelial cells contain PDE IV and PDE III, and in addition, PDE I is measured in macrophages and PDE II in endothelial cells. These basal cell-specific PDE isoenzyme profiles appear to be modified by: 1) substrate concentration; 2) kinase-dependent phosphorylation; and 3) regulated rate of synthesis. Therefore, PDE isoenzyme profiles represent dynamic patterns, which apparently adapt to pathological and environmental conditions. In parallel functional studies, the influence of mono-selective (rolipram, PDE IV; motapizone, PDE III), dual-selective (zardaverine) and non-selective (theophylline) PDE inhibitors were compared. Corresponding to isoenzyme analysis, it was demonstrated that both PDE III and PDE IV have to be inhibited for complete suppression of either tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) release from macrophages, or lymphocyte proliferation (PDE III/IV cells). In eosinophils (PDE IV cells) platelet-activating factor (PAF)-induced chemotaxis or C5a-stimulated degranulation are only weakly inhibited by rolipram alone. After addition of a beta 2-agonist, however, the efficacy of rolipram is enhanced due to concomitant influence of synthesis and breakdown of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Theophylline inhibits PDE isoenzyme activities and functions of inflammatory cells with similar potency, and exhibits higher functional efficacy as compared to rolipram.",

Several strategies for the development of antiangiogenic therapeutic modalities have been employed, including agents that (1) decrease the activity of specific angiogenic factors, (2) decrease th$ activity of endothelial survival factors, (3) increase the activity of naturally occurring antiangiogenic agents, or (4) indirectly downregulate angiogenic and survivalfactor activity. Because antiangiogenic therapy is unlikely to induce tumor regression, the criteria for efficacy must be evaluated by means other than the standard response criteria used to evaluate cytotoxic chemotherapy. Further, the redundancy of molecules responsible for the angiogenic process suggests it is unlikely that a single antiangiogenic agent will provide prolonged inhibition of angiogenesis. Nevertheless, the understanding of the basic principles that drive tumor angiogenesis will lead to the development of therapies that will likely prolong survival without the toxicity associated with standard chemotherapy.",

    "title": "Alcohol and mitochondria: a dysfunctional relationship.",
    "abstract": "Mitochondria are intimately involved in the generation of and defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondria are themselves targets of oxidative stress and also contribute to mechanisms by which oxidative stress-related signals control cell fate. Ethanol promotes oxidative stress, both by increasing ROS formation and by decreasing cellular defense mechanisms. These effects of ethanol are prominent in the liver, the major site of ethanol metabolism in the body. The question remains to what extent this contributes to ethanol-dependent tissue damage or the susceptibility of cells to other stressors. In this review, we consider how mitochondrial actions of ethanol influence oxidative stress management of liver cells. Mitochondrial electron transport constitutes the major intracellular source of ROS, and ethanol treatment imposes conditions that promote ROS formation by mitochondria, the effects of which may be enhanced by a decrease in mitochondrial oxidative stress defenses. A significant target of ethanol-related increases in oxidative stress is mitochondrial DNA. Ethanol-induced damage to mitochondrial DNA, if not adequately repaired, impairs mitochondrial function, which further increases oxidative stress in the cell, leading to a vicious cycle of accumulating cell damage that is more apparent with advancing age. Uncontrolled mitochondrial formation of ROS promotes the inappropriate activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition, increasing the sensitivity of cells to other pro-apoptotic or damage signals. In combination with ethanol-induced defects in mitochondrial function, these alterations may promote both apoptotic and necrotic cell death in response to otherwise benign or beneficial challenges and contribute to the onset or progression of alcohol-induced liver diseases.",

    "title": "DNA topoisomerase I and II as targets for rational design of new anticancer drugs.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Topoisomerase I and II (topo I and II) are enzymes which alter the topological state of DNA through DNA strand cleavage, strand passage and religation. They participate in most aspects of DNA metabolism and are therefore vital to the cell undergoing division. Only one form of topo I has been identified whereas two isoenzymes of topo II have been described: the alpha form (170 kDa protein) and beta form (180 kDa protein). Both topo II isoenzymes have distinct nuclear localisation, are regulated independently, differ in their responsiveness to inhibitors and are differentially expressed in drug resistant cell lines.RESULTS: Several clinically active anticancer drugs (e.g., doxorubicin, m-AMSA, VP-16 and camptothecins) poison these enzymes by stabilizing a putative reaction intermediate called the cleavable complex (cc) where the topoisomerase remains covalently attached to either one strand of DNA (topo I) or both strands of double helix (topo II) after strand cleavage. DNA cleavage sites appear unique for different classes of inhibitor, and are probably critical for defining cytotoxicity. Formation of the cc may cause cell death either by colliding with replication forks, by promoting illegitimate genomic-DNA recombination, by arresting cells in the G2-phase of the cell cycle or by inducing apoptosis.CONCLUSION: New classes of inhibitor have recently been described with novel mechanisms of action including compounds which do not stabilize cleavable complexes or bind significantly to DNA. These may prove to be more selective and less toxic. They may also avoid the possible problem of therapy-related leukemias associated with topo inhibitors which induce DNA cleavage and chromosomal aberrations.",

Extensive use of statins has led to the increase of some undesirable effects that are heavily counterbalanced by the benefits. Indeed, pleiotropic effects extend far beyond cholesterol reduction and involve non-lipid-related mechanisms that modify endothelial functions, immunoinflammatory responses, smooth muscle cell activation, proliferation and migration, atherosclerotic plaque stability, and thrombus formation.

Compounds that inhibit kit kinase, such as indolinones, are therefore attractive as potential therapeutic agents. A hierarchy exists in the ability of compounds to inhibit kit kinase effectively. Some compounds can inhibit ligand-induced activation of wild-type receptor but are ineffective against constitutively activated mutants. Other compounds can inhibit ligand-induced activation of wild-type kit and ligand-independent activation by juxtamembrane domain mutations but not activation by activation loop mutations. Still others effectively inhibit wild-type kit and constitutively activated kit bearing either juxtamembrane or kinase domain mutations and kill the neoplastic mast cells expressing these mutants. No therapy currently exists that specifically targets a cause of mastocytosis, but there are good reasons to believe that kit kinase inhibitors may fulfill that role someday.",

Insight into the nature of the alloantigen and the mechanisms underlying T cell recognition, activation, and differentiation provide novel targets for immunotherapy. Appreciation of the role that peptides present in the human leukocyte antigen groove play in allorecognition provides a new target for synthetic peptide therapy. Elucidation of signal transduction pathways downstream from the T-cell receptor helps to explain the mechanism of action of immunosuppressive agents and impacts the design of new drugs. An understanding of the role of costimulatory molecules, such as CD28, has given rise to new therapies, such as CTLA4-Ig.

    "title": "[Preventive medicine: biomonitoring and chemoprevention].",
    "abstract": "The aim of chemoprevention is to delay or prevent the development of pathological conditions, or to correct abnormal regulatory mechanisms and in some cases even reverse the process. For this intervention to succeed, biomarkers must be found that characterize impaired health status in a phase when impairment is still reversible. Genotoxicological parameters may function as biomarkers of this kind, such as inhibition or delay of mitosis, inhibition of apoptosis, increase in the number of chromosomal aberrations, decrease in the capacity of DNA repairing enzymes, or parameters characterizing immunological status (eg. decreased NK activity). With the help of early signs, impending negative changes or illness (which could not be prevented without effective chemoprevention) can be predicted in apparently healthy individuals. Thus, the first and most important step in chemoprevention is risk characterization. Risk characterization is a complex concept, which includes risk analysis, risk assessment and risk management. Chemoprevention is a part of the latter process. Biomarkers, which can be studied mainly by up-to-date molecular biological methods, are used in discovering risk factors and also in the assessment of caused biological effects. Besides avoiding risk factors, it is very important to strengthen the protective mechanisms, to promote the metabolism of toxic substances, and to repair damage (ward off denaturation of macromolecules caused by free oxygen radicals with antioxidants for example). Chemopreventive agents are therefore diverse in their targets. Most of them have antioxidant properties, such as plant-derived substances, like glycosides, flavonoids, various vitamins, carotinoids, and some trace elements such as selenium. Another group of chemopreventive agents inhibit cell proliferation, or induce programmed cell death (apoptosis). Another group influence terminal differentiation, or inhibit angiogenesis. Some chemopreventive agents affect the metabolism or detoxification of xenobiotics, or boost the functions of the immune system. In many cases these effects are mediated by the rate of methylation of DNA molecules.",

Twelve volunteers, aged 22-34 yr, were recruited. At targets of 20, 50 and and 80 mg 100 ml-1, the mean (SD) BAC was 22.1 (3.7), 51.5 (3.3) and 80.5 (4.2) mg 100 ml-1, respectively. The peak BAC following an oral dose of alcohol 0.75 mg kg-1 ranged from 19 to 68 mg 100 ml-1. In psychomotor testing, choice reaction time deteriorated with increasing BAC and showed significant differences between baseline and the 50 (P < 0.05) and 80 mg 100 ml-1 (P < 0.01) conditions. Dual-task secondary reaction time deteriorated with increasing BAC and showed a statistically significant difference between all groups and baseline (oral and 20 mg groups, P < 0.05; 50 and 80 mg groups, P < 0.01). Dual-task tracking in the 50 and 80 mg groups was significantly different from baseline (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). Oral dosing resulted in widely variable BACs, making it difficult to assess psychomotor impairment reliably. An intravenous infusion enables the BAC to be maintained within a narrow range.

Exposure of the respiratory system to a wide range of chemicals and environmental toxicants during perinatal life has the potential to significantly affect the maturation, growth, and function of this organ system. Although the potential targets for exposure to toxic factors are currently not known, they are likely to affect critical molecular signals expressed during distinct stages of lung development. The effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke during critical windows of perinatal growth are provided as an example leading to altered cellular and physiological function of the lungs. An understanding of critical windows of exposure of the respiratory system on children's health requires consideration that lung development is a multistep process and cannot be based on studies in adults.",

    "title": "Mechanisms of endocannabinoid inactivation: biochemistry and pharmacology.",
    "abstract": "The endocannabinoids, a family of endogenous lipids that activate cannabinoid receptors, are released from cells in a stimulus-dependent manner by cleavage of membrane lipid precursors. After release, the endocannabinoids are rapidly deactivated by uptake into cells and enzymatic hydrolysis. Endocannabinoid reuptake occurs via a carrier-mediated mechanism, which has not yet been molecularly characterized. Endocannabinoid reuptake has been demonstrated in discrete brain regions and in various tissues and cells throughout the body. Inhibitors of endocannabinoid reuptake include N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-arachidonylamide (AM404), which blocks transport with IC50 (concentration necessary to produce half-maximal inhibition) values in the low micromolar range. AM404 does not directly activate cannabinoid receptors or display cannabimimetic activity in vivo. Nevertheless, AM404 increases circulating anandamide levels and inhibits motor activity, an effect that is prevented by the CB1 cannabinoid antagonist N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide hydrochloride (SR141716A). AM404 also reduces behavioral responses to dopamine agonists and normalizes motor activity in a rat model of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The endocannabinoids are hydrolyzed by an intracellular membrane-bound enzyme, termed anandamide amidohydrolase (AAH), which has been molecularly cloned. Several fatty acid sulfonyl fluorides inhibit AAH activity irreversibly with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range and protect anandamide from deactivation in vivo. alpha-Keto-oxazolopyridines inhibit AAH activity with high potency (IC50 values in the low picomolar range). A more thorough characterization of the roles of endocannabinoids in health and disease will be necessary to define the significance of endocannabinoid inactivation mechanisms as targets for therapeutic drugs.",

    "title": "Matrix metalloproteases: variations on a theme.",
    "abstract": "The family of proteins called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a class of structurally related proteins that are collectively responsible for the metabolism of extracellular matrix proteins. These zinc and calcium dependent enzymes, which include the collagenases, stromelysins and gelatinases, are involved in normal tissue remodelling processes such as wound healing, pregnancy and angiogenesis. Under physiological conditions, in addition to the regulated proteolyses of inactive precursors to the active form, the degradative nature of these enzymes are precisely controlled by endogenous inhibitors (TIMPs). The excess syntheses and production of these proteins lead to the accelerated matrix degradation associated with diseases such as arthritis, cancer and multiple sclerosis. The MMPs have therefore proved to be attractive targets for structure based drug design. The pursuit of low molecular weight inhibitors of these proteins have encouraged structural studies on several members of family, so that the molecular details of enzyme-inhibitor interactions of the MMPs have become available. These studies provide insights into the basic structural framework of the MMP superfamily and reveal characteristics which promote specificity between individual members. The analyses of the three dimensional structure of the MMPs in the context of their primary sequence and the design and selectivity of low molecular weight inhibitors of the superfamily is the subject of this review.",

    "abstract": "Most acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cases have t(15;17)(q22;q21) chromosomal translocation and PML-RARalpha chimeric gene which blocks granulocytic differentiation. The introduction of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic compounds, especially arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)), has provided good models to study not only differentiation and/or apoptosis therapy but also molecular target-based cancer treatment. In vivo and in vitro investigations have shown that both agents are able to induce differentiation of APL cells: ATRA tends to induce terminal differentiation, while low-dose As(2)O(3) can induce partial differentiation. Significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms of APL pathogenesis and differentiation therapy. Pharmacological concentrations (0.1 approximately 1 microM) of ATRA derepresses transcription by releasing CoR from, and recruiting CoA to PML-RARalpha, whereas As(2)O(3) triggers a rapid degradation of PML-RARalpha. In fact, the two drugs act on the same oncoprotein through targeting different moieties and in distinct ways and thereby abrogate its dominant-negative effects on regulatory pathways necessary for granulocytic differentiation. As to apoptosis, it is clear that high-dose As(2)O(3) can induce mitochondria-mediated cell death pathway in a thiol-dependent manner, while the mechanism of ATRA-induced apoptosis needs further elucidation. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis are also expected to find new molecular targets. It is the hope that what we have learnt from APL will benefit further developments of anti-leukemia therapy.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-2 has been widely used in HIV-1+ subjects as an immunoactivating agent. In this study, we investigated cytokine production, Ki67 antigen expression and the modulation of the surface phenotype of the CD4/CD25+ subset as compared to the reciprocal CD4/CD25- subset in IL-2-treated HIV+ patients. Our findings suggest that CD4 T cells are heterogeneous in responding to IL-2, because CD4/CD25+ cells sharply increased their \"memory\" phenotype, their Ki67 antigen expression and were the main in vivo targets for IL-2-dependent proliferation during therapy, while the percentages of IFN-gamma+ (terminally differentiated) cells remained unchanged at the end of therapy. Conversely, the CD4+/CD25- subpopulation showed an expansion of differentiated cells and a slight increase in the proliferation rate. The use of anti-retroviral therapy alone (HAART) reduced the proliferation and increased the differentiation of both CD4 subsets. Our data suggest that IL-2 has a moderate capacity to activate resting T cells in vivo and is probably unable to boost HIV-1 from latency to the replicative state.",

    "abstract": "Spermatogenesis is an intriguing but complicated biological process. However, many studies since the 1960s have focused either on the hormonal events of the hypothalamus-pituitary-testicular axis or morphological events that take place in the seminiferous epithelium. Recent advances in biochemistry, cell biology, and molecular biology have shifted attention to understanding some of the key events that regulate spermatogenesis, such as germ cell apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, Sertoli-germ cell communication, and junction dynamics. In this review, we discuss the physiology and biology of junction dynamics in the testis, in particular how these events affect interactions of Sertoli and germ cells in the seminiferous epithelium behind the blood-testis barrier. We also discuss how these events regulate the opening and closing of the blood-testis barrier to permit the timely passage of preleptotene and leptotene spermatocytes across the blood-testis barrier. This is physiologically important since developing germ cells must translocate across the blood-testis barrier as well as traverse the seminiferous epithelium during their development. We also discuss several available in vitro and in vivo models that can be used to study Sertoli-germ cell anchoring junctions and Sertoli-Sertoli tight junctions. An in-depth survey in this subject has also identified several potential targets to be tackled to perturb spermatogenesis, which will likely lead to the development of novel male contraceptives.",

    "title": "Steroid hormones and brain development: some guidelines for understanding actions of pseudohormones and other toxic agents.",
    "abstract": "Gonadal, adrenal, and thyroid hormones affect the brain directly, and the sensitivity to hormones begins in embryonic life with the appearance of hormone receptor sites in discrete populations of neurons. Because the secretion of hormones is also under control by its neural and pituitary targets, the brain-endocrine axis during development is in a delicately balanced state that can be upset in various ways, and any agent that disrupts normal hormone secretion can upset normal brain development. Moreover, exogenous substances that mimic the actions of natural hormones can also play havoc with CNS development and differentiation. This paper addresses these issues in the following order: First, actions of glucocorticoids on the developing nervous system related to cell division dendritic growth and neurotransmitter phenotype will be presented followed by a discussion of the developmental effects of synthetic steroids. Second, actions of estrogens related to brain sexual differentiation will be described, followed by a discussion of the actions of the nonsteroidal estrogen, diethylstilbestrol, as an example of exogenous estrogenic substances. The most important aspect of the potency of exogenous estrogens appears to be the degree to which they either bypass protective mechanisms or are subject to transformations to more active metabolites. Third, agents that influence hormone levels or otherwise modify the neuroendocrine system, such as nicotine, barbiturates, alcohol, opiates, and tetrahydrocannabinol, will be noted briefly to demonstrate the diversity of toxic agents that can influence neural development and affect personality, cognitive ability, and other aspects of behavior.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

This group is unrelated to the classical trypsin and subtilisin families, and includes dipeptidyl peptidase IV, acylaminoacyl peptidase and oligopeptidase B, in addition to the prototype prolyl oligopeptidase. The recent crystal structure determination of prolyl oligopeptidase (80 kDa) has shown that the enzyme contains a peptidase domain with an alpha/beta hydrolase fold, and its catalytic triad is covered by the central tunnel of an unusual seven-bladed beta-propeller. This domain operates as a gating filter, excluding large, structured peptides from the active site. The binding mode of substrates and the catalytic mechanism differ from that of the classical serine peptidases in several features. The members of the family are important targets of drug design. Prolyl oligopeptidase is involved in amnesia, depression and blood pressure control, dipeptidyl peptidase IV in type 2 diabetes and oligopeptidase B in trypanosomiasis.",

    "abstract": "Tumour development is a multi-step process during which genetic and epigenetic events determine the transition from a normal to a malignant cellular state. In the past decade, extensive effort has been made not only to define the molecular mechanisms underlying progression to malignancy but also to predict the development of the disease and to identify possible molecular targets for therapy. Common to most tumours, several regulatory circuits are altered during multistage tumour progression, most importantly, the control of proliferation, the balance between cell survival and programmed cell death (apoptosis), the communication with neighbouring cells and the extracellular matrix, the induction of tumour neovascularization (angiogenesis) and, finally, tumour cell migration, invasion and metastatic dissemination. De-regulation of each of these processes represents a rate-limiting step for tumour development and, hence, has to be achieved by tumour cells in a highly selective manner during tumour progression. In this review we summarize recent advances in cancer research that have provided new insights in the molecular mechanisms underlying the transition between one tumour stage and the next and into their concerted action during tumour progression. Cultured human tumour cell lines as well as transgenic and knock-out mouse models of tumorigenesis have been instrumental in these experimental approaches.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Transgenic and knockout technologies have emerged from the \"molecular biology revolution\" as unprecedented techniques for manipulating gene function in intact mice. The goals of this review are to outline the techniques of creating transgenic and knockout mice, and to demonstrate their use in elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying common surgical diseases.SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Gain of gene function is created by transgenic technology, whereas gene function is ablated using gene knockouts. Each technique has distinctive applications and drawbacks. A unique feature of genetically manipulated mice is that combinatorial genetic experiments can be executed that precisely define the functional contribution of a gene to disease progression. Transgenic and knockout mouse models of wound healing, cardiovascular disease, transplant immunology, gut motility and inflammatory bowel disease, and oncology are beginning to illuminate the precise molecular regulation of these diseases. Transgenic technology has also been extended to larger mammals such as pigs, with the goal of using genetic manipulation of the xenogenic immune response to increase the availability of transplant organs. Continual refinements in gene manipulation technology in mice offer the opportunity to turn genes on or off at precise time intervals and in particular tissues, according to the needs of the investigator. Ultimately, investigation of disease development and progression in genetically manipulated mammals may delineate new molecular targets for drug discovery and provide novel platforms for drug efficacy screens.CONCLUSIONS: Emulation of human disease and therapy using genetically manipulated mammals fulfills a promise of molecular medicine: fusion of molecular biochemistry with \"classical\" biology and physiology. Surgeons have unique skills spanning both worlds that can facilitate their success in this expanding arena.",

In parallel with this effort, new approaches are being developed for the elucidation of the functional content of the human genome. The mouse will have an important role in this phase of the genome project as a model system. In this review we discuss and compare classical genetic approaches to gene function-phenotype-based mutagenesis screens aimed at the establishment of a large collection of single gene mutations affecting a wide range of phenotypic traits in the mouse. Whereas large scale genome-wide screens that are directed at the identification of all loci contributing to a specific phenotype may be impractical, region-specific saturation screens that provide mutations within a delimited chromosomal region are a feasible alternative. Region-specific screens in the mouse can be performed in only two generations by combining high-efficiency chemical mutagenesis with deletion complexes generated using embryonic stem (ES) cells. The ability to create and analyze deletion complexes rapidly, as well as to map novel chemically-induced mutations within these complexes, will facilitate systematic functional analysis of the mouse genome and corresponding gene sequences in humans. Furthermore, as the extent of the mouse genome sequencing effort is still uncertain, we underscore a necessity to direct sequencing efforts to those chromosomal regions that are targets for extensive mutagenesis screens.",

Due to their unique characteristics, hematologic malignancies represent an ideal target for vaccine-based therapeutic interventions.METHODS: A review of published vaccine studies in experimental models as well as the results of clinical trials using vaccines for patients with hematologic tumors is presented.RESULTS: Tumor vaccine strategies can be divided into two categories: antigen-specific strategies, in which the tumor antigens have been identified and can be isolated to develop a molecularly defined vaccine, and cellular or non-antigen-specific, in which the tumor-specific antigens are unknown but presumed to exist within the material used to generate the vaccine. Early clinical trials have shown not only the feasibility and safety of either approach but also the obstacles in therapeutic cancer vaccination as an effective treatment modality for hematologic malignancies.CONCLUSIONS: Active immunization using current cancer vaccine approaches is feasible and safe. Although no major successes have been reported, the positive clinical results observed in some patients support the potential for therapeutic cancer vaccination in the management of hematologic malignancies. Results of studies that are testing vaccine formulations, targets, and settings (eg, bone marrow transplantation) may support the use of cancer vaccination as an efficient therapeutic strategy against tumors of hematologic origin.",

    "abstract": "Progress in understanding mechanisms of disease are necessary to usher in major changes in treatment. A new era in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and related chronic autoimmune/inflammatory diseases is now beginning, with a variety of anti-TNFalpha treatments licensed for use in both RA and Crohn's disease. The rationale for this new treatment lies in an understanding that cytokines are critical, rate limiting molecules lying at the heart of the chronic autoimmune/inflammatory disease process. This understanding was developed from the critical evaluation of a hypothesis that was proposed linking cytokines, antigen presentation and autoimmunity in 1983. Detailed analysis focusing on the major site of the disease, the rheumatoid synovium was essential to developing indications that blockade of TNFalpha might be efficacious. This clue was validated using anti-TNFalpha treatment of an animal model of RA, murine collagen induced arthritis, and by immunohistochemical demonstration of upregulated TNF and TNF-R expression in the synovium. With this three pronged rationale, the authors were able to convince Centocor, Inc, which had developed a chimaeric anti-TNFalpha antibody for use in sepsis, to work with them to test the concept that TNFalpha blockade would be beneficial in RA. With the success of that first trial, other companies have subsequently tested their anti-TNF strategies successfully. Current interests extend to understanding the processes that regulate TNF production in the rheumatoid joint. Progress in this area is discussed, using adenoviruses to infect normal macrophages and rheumatoid synovium.",

Herein we explore clues that can be gleaned from clinical, epidemiological, pathological, and experimental data. These suggest that abnormalities of the extracellular matrix of retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells may promote a pro-angiogenic RPE phenotype that contributes to the development of CNV. This provides a general hypothesis that can be tested, but it is also necessary to test hypotheses regarding the specific alterations in gene expression that contribute to CNV.

Epidemiological studies have indicated that 85% of all lung cancer deaths and 30% of all cancer deaths in the U.S. are associated with tobacco smoking. Various chemicals in tobacco smoke are thought to react with DNA and to ultimately yield heritable mutations. In an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in lung tumorigenesis, we have analyzed proto-oncogene activation in a series of human lung tumors from smokers and spontaneously occurring and chemically induced lung tumors in mice. Approximately 86% of the human lung tumors and greater than 90% of the mouse lung tumors were found to contain activated oncogenes. ras Oncogenes activated by point mutations were detected in many of the human lung adenocarcinomas and virtually all of the mouse lung adenomas and adenocarcinomas. The mutation profiles of the activated K-ras genes detected in the chemically induced mouse lung tumors suggest that the observed mutations result from genotoxic effects of the chemicals. Comparison of the K-ras mutations observed in the human lung adenocarcinomas with mutation profiles observed in the mouse lung tumors suggest that bulky hydrophobic DNA adducts may be responsible for the majority of the mutations observed in the activated human K-ras genes. Other data indicate that approximately 20% of human lung tumors contain potentially novel transforming genes that may also be targets for mutagens in cigarette smoke.",

    "title": "Chemotherapy of metastatic breast cancer: what to expect in 2001 and beyond.",
    "abstract": "Chemotherapy plays an important role in the management of metastatic breast cancer. The anthracyclines (doxorubicin, epirubicin) and the taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel) are considered the most active agents for patients with advanced breast cancer. Traditionally, the anthracyclines have been used in combination with cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil (FAC, FEC). The taxanes have single-agent activity similar to older combination chemotherapy treatments. There is great interest in developing anthracycline/taxane combinations. Capecitabine is indicated for patients who progress after anthracycline and taxane therapy. Vinorelbine and gemcitabine have activity in patients with metastatic breast cancer and are commonly used as third- and fourth-line palliative therapy. The role of high-dose chemotherapy is not well-defined and remains experimental. Novel cytotoxic therapy strategies include the development of anthracycline, taxane, and oral fluoropyrimidine analogues; antifolates; topoisomerase I inhibitors, and multidrug resistance inhibitors. A better understanding of the biology of breast cancer is providing novel treatment approaches. Oncogenes and tumor-supressor genes are emerging as important targets for therapy. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the Her-2/neu protein, has been shown to prolong survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Other novel biologic therapies interfere with signal transduction pathways and angiogenesis. The challenge for the next decade will be to integrate these promising agents in the management of metastatic and primary breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a DNA-activated nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase. DNA-PK consists of a regulatory sub-unit, the heterodimeric Ku protein (composed of a 70- and a 86-kDa subunit) which binds DNA ends and targets the catalytic sub-unit, DNA-PKcs to DNA strand breaks. DNA-PK plays a major role in the repair of double-strand breaks induced in DNA after exposure to ionizing radiation as shown by the extreme radiosensitivity of cells with mutations in Ku86, Ku70 or DNA-PKcs genes. Cells deficient in DNA-PK activity also exhibit hypersensitivity to genotoxic drugs such as cisplatin and nitrogen mustards. In the first part of this review, the current knowledge on the biochemical characteristics of DNA-PK, its mechanism of action in DNA repair and the phenotype of DNA-PK deficient cells is summarized. These results suggest that DNA-PK might play a role in the acquisition of a resistant phenotype of human tumors to radiotherapy, chemotherapy using genotoxic drugs or to both treatments. In the second part of this review, the studies devoted to inhibition of DNA-PK in order to enhance cancer therapy by DNA-damaging agents are presented.",

    "title": "Febrile seizures: treatment and prognosis.",
    "abstract": "Recent epidemiologic data indicate that the vast majority of children with febrile seizures have a normal longterm outcome. A precise knowledge of the short- and long-term outcome with or without treatment, and short- and long-term side effects is an important prerequisite for assessing the various treatment strategies. We focus on the impact of short-term or prophylactic treatment on the short- and long-term outcome of various types of febrile seizures. There is universal agreement that daily prophylaxis with antiepileptic agents should never be used routinely in simple febrile seizures, but only in highly selected cases, if at all. Intermittent diazepam (DZP) prophylaxis at times of fever may or may not reduce the recurrence rate, but it does not appear to improve the long-term outcome as compared with short-term seizure control. The treatment may be used to reduce the recurrence rate for a small arbitrarily defined group with multiple simple febrile seizures, complex febrile seizures, especially focal, prolonged or both, febrile status, and when parental anxiety is severe. However, there is no evidence that treatment of simple febrile seizures can prevent the rare cases of later epilepsy, and many children with complex febrile seizures have a benign long-term outcome, even without treatment. Many prefer a \"wait and see\" policy. An attractive alternative is to treat new febrile seizures with rectal DZP in solution at seizure onset, given by the parents at home to prevent febrile status. Newer, less well documented short-term strategies include nasal, oral, or rectal administration of other benzodiazepines. Short-term seizure control of febrile status and careful parental counseling are the two most important targets of treatment.",

    "title": "generation. We review recent in vivo microdialysis, in vitro superfusion, and in situ hybridization experiments in which we tested the hypothesis that the amplitude and frequency of LHRH pulses are subject to independent regulation via distinct and identifiable cellular pathways. 2. Augmentation of LHRH pulse amplitude is proposed as a central feature of preovulatory LHRH surges. Three mechanisms are described which may contribute to this increase in LHRH pulse amplitude: (a) increased LHRH gene expression, (b) augmentation of facilitatory neurotransmission, and (c) increased responsiveness of LHRH neurons to afferent synaptic signals. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is examined as a prototypical afferent transmitter regulating the generation of LHRH surges through the latter two mechanisms. 3. Retardation of LHRH pulse generator frequency is postulated to mediate negative feedback actions of gonadal hormones. Evidence supporting this hypothesis is reviewed, including results of in vivo monitoring experiments in which LHRH pulse frequency, but not amplitude, is shown to be increased following castration. A role for noradrenergic neurons as intervening targets of gonadal hormone negative feedback actions is discussed. 4. Future directions for study of the LHRH pulse generator are suggested.",

This has not been demonstrated for high-dose (greater than 18 x 10(6) IU/m2 per day) IL-2. We completed phase II trials of sustained administration of indomethacin and ranitidine with IL-2 given as a continuous infusion over 5 days for three courses. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, both fresh and cultured in vitro with IL-2 or IL-2 and indomethacin, were tested for tumoricidal function against K562 and Daudi targets; these results were then correlated with actual delivered dose and mean infusion rate per course. Similar correlations were calculated between delivered dose or infusion rate and absolute and proportional counts of lymphocyte subsets as determined by flow cytometry. No enhancement of in vitro tumoricidal function with either increasing delivered dose or increasing infusion rate was seen. No consistent pattern of correlation was found between the absolute counts of lymphocyte subsets after each course of IL-2 with delivered dose or infusion rate. The percent rise in absolute counts of selected T- and NK-cell subsets at the end of course 1 compared with baseline values correlated positively with infusion rate; however, a similar correlated between the infusion rate and an increase in lymphocyte tumoricidal function was lacking. Little evidence was found for improved tumoricidal function of mononuclear cells or consistent enhancement of lymphocyte subset counts in patients able to tolerate doses of IL-2 beyond 18 x 10(6) IU/m2 per day in a 5-day continuous infusion schedule.",

    "title": "Targeting critical regions in genomic DNA with AT-specific anticancer drugs.",
    "abstract": "Cellular DNA is not a uniform target for DNA-reactive drugs. At the nucleotide level, drugs recognize and bind short motifs of a few base pairs. The location of drug adducts at the genomic level depends on how these short motifs are distributed in larger domains. This aspect, referred to as region specificity, may be critical for the biological outcome of drug action. Recent studies demonstrated that certain minor groove binding (MGB) drugs, such as bizelesin, produce region-specific lesions in cellular DNA. Bizelesin binds mainly T(A/T)(4)A sites, which are on average scarce, but occasionally cluster in distinct minisatellite regions (200-1000 bp of approximately 85-100% AT), herein referred to as AT islands. Bizelesin-targeted AT islands are likely to function as strong matrix attachment regions (MARs), domains that organize DNA loops on the nuclear matrix. Distortion of MAR-like AT islands may be a basis for the observed inhibition of new replicon initiation and the extreme lethality of bizelesin adducts (<10 adducts/cell for cell growth inhibition). Hence, long AT-islands represent a novel class of critical targets for anticancer drugs. The AT island paradigm illustrates the potential of the concept of regional targeting as an essential component of the rational design of new sequence-specific DNA-reactive drugs.",

We investigated whether the AIN was the result of a cellular cytotoxic reaction induced by the rIL-2 treatment. The cytolytic activity of cryopreserved peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), isolated before and at the end of the rIL-2 treatment (at the time of AIN), was studied after 5 days of culture with or without rIL-2 or anti-CD28 and immobilized anti-CD3 antibodies. The PBL isolated before and at the end of the rIL-2 treatment showed cytolytic activity towards a number of allogeneic targets. However, only the PBL isolated at the end of the rIL-2 treatment showed, when stimulated with rIL-2 in vitro, significant cytolytic activity against an autologous renal cell line cultured from the AIN biopsy specimen and against an allogeneic renal cell cancer cell line. These PBL displayed no enhanced killing capacity towards autologous PBL and the melanoma cell line M14. These observations suggest that the AIN may be the result of a cytotoxic lymphocyte-mediated reaction induced by the rIL-2 treatment.",

    "abstract": "Nosocomial pneumonia is a notable cause of morbidity and mortality and leads to increases in lengths of hospital stays and institutional expenditures. Aminoglycosides are used to treat patients with these infections, but few data on the doses and schedules required to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes exist. We analyzed aminoglycoside treatment data for 78 patients with nosocomial pneumonia to determine if optimization of aminoglycoside pharmacodynamic parameters results in a more rapid therapeutic response (defined by outcome and days to leukocyte count resolution and temperature resolution). Cox proportional hazards, Classification and Regression Tree (CART), and logistic regression analyses were applied to the data. By all analyses, the first measured maximum concentration of drug in serum (Cmax)/MIC predicted days to temperature resolution and the second measured Cmax/MIC predicted days to leukocyte count resolution. For days to temperature resolution and leukocyte count resolution, CART analyses produced breakpoints, with an 89% success rate at 7 days of therapy for a Cmax/MIC of > 4.7 and an 86% success rate at 7 days of therapy for a Cmax/MIC of > 4.5, respectively. Logistic regression analyses predicted a 90% probability of temperature resolution and leukocyte count resolution by day 7 if a Cmax/MIC of > or = 10 is achieved within the first 48 h of aminoglycoside therapy. Aggressive aminoglycoside dosing immediately followed by individualized pharmacokinetic monitoring would ensure that Cmax/MIC targets are achieved early in therapy. This would increase the probability of a rapid therapeutic response for pneumonia caused by gram-negative bacteria and potentially decreasing durations of parenteral antibiotic therapy, lengths of hospitalization, and institutional expenditures, a situation in which both the patient and the institution benefit.",

    "title": "The architecture of parallel beta-helices and related folds.",
    "abstract": "Three-dimensional structures have been determined of a large number of proteins characterized by a repetitive fold where each of the repeats (coils) supplies a strand to one or more parallel beta-sheets. Some of these proteins form superfamilies of proteins, which have probably arisen by divergent evolution from a common ancestor. The classical example is the family including four families of pectinases without obviously related primary sequences, the phage P22 tailspike endorhamnosidase, chrondroitinase B and possibly pertactin from Bordetella pertusis. These show extensive stacking of similar residues to give aliphatic, aromatic and polar stacks such as the asparagine ladder. This suggests that coils can be added or removed by duplication or deletion of the DNA corresponding to one or more coils and explains how homologous proteins can have different numbers of coils. This process can also account for the evolution of other families of proteins such as the beta-rolls, the leucine-rich repeat proteins, the hexapeptide repeat family, two separate families of beta-helical antifreeze proteins and the spiral folds. These families need not be related to each other but will share features such as relative untwisted beta-sheets, stacking of similar residues and turns between beta-strands of approximately 90 degrees often stabilized by hydrogen bonding along the direction of the parallel beta-helix.Repetitive folds present special problems in the comparison of structures but offer attractive targets for structure prediction. The stacking of similar residues on a flat parallel beta-sheet may account for the formation of amyloid with beta-strands at right-angles to the fibril axis from many unrelated peptides.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy is often mediated by overexpression of P-glycoprotein, a plasma membrane ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter which extrudes cytotoxic drugs at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. P-glycoprotein (ABCB1, according to the human gene nomenclature committee) consists of two homologous halves each containing a transmembrane domain (TMD) involved in drug binding and efflux, and a cytosolic nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, with an overall (TMD-NBD)2 domain topology. Homologous ABC multidrug transporters, from the same ABCB family, are found in many species such as Plasmodiumfalciparum and Leishmania spp. protozoa, where they induce resistance to antiparasitic drugs. In yeasts, some ABC transporters involved in resistance to fungicides, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pdr5p and Snq2p, display a different (NBD-TMD)2 domain topology and are classified in another family, ABCG. Much effort has been spent to modulate multidrug resistance in the different species by using specific inhibitors, but generally with little success due to additional cellular targets and/or extrusion of the potential inhibitors. This review shows that due to similarities in function and maybe in three-dimensional organization of the different transporters, common potential modulators have been found. An in vitro 'rational screening' was performed among the large flavonoid family using a four-step procedure: (i) direct binding to purified recombinant cytosolic NBD and/or full-length transporter, (ii) inhibition of ATP hydrolysis and energy-dependent drug interaction with transporter-enriched membranes, (iii) inhibition of cell transporter activity monitored by flow cytometry and (iv) chemosensitization of cell growth. The results indicate that prenylated flavonoids bind with high affinity, and strongly inhibit drug interaction and nucleotide hydrolysis. As such, they constitute promising potential modulators of multidrug resistance.",

    "abstract": "The third set of guidelines recently issued by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) differs from the second set issued in 1993 in several ways. The third set introduced a quantitative risk scoring system and identified and/or reclassified certain groups of patients at high or moderate risk for a coronary event. Among these groups are patients with type 2 diabetes, and patients with multiple risk factors other than coronary heart disease or diabetes that cumulatively confer high risk for a coronary event. However, the new guidelines also present physicians with the major challenges of identifying these patients, determining their true risk, and implementing the recommended approaches to treatment in clinical practice settings. Although reducing elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol remains the primary focus of therapy, the new NCEP guidelines also include strategies to identify and treat patients with low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and/or elevated triglyceride levels. Just as there is \"good\" cholesterol (HDL) and \"bad\" cholesterol (LDL), there are also \"good\" triglycerides, which contain high concentrations of triglyceride remnants and are associated with low risk, and \"bad\" triglycerides, which contain high concentrations of cholesterol remnants and are associated with increased risk. The mechanisms by which \"bad\" triglycerides develop explain why elevated triglycerides and low HDL--and patients with the metabolic syndrome--warrant special attention. These mechanisms and others also suggest new targets for therapeutic intervention and the development of new drugs that will correct lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities through a number of different metabolic pathways.",

    "abstract": "Glutamate and GABA neurotransmission is mediated through various types of ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. In this review, we summarise some of our recent findings on the subcellular and subsynaptic localisation of GABA(B) and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors in the striatopallidal complex of monkeys. Polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognise GABA(B)R1, mGluR1a and mGluR5 receptor subtypes were used for immunoperoxidase and pre-embedding immunogold techniques at the light and electron microscope levels. Both subtypes of group I mGluRs were expressed postsynaptically in striatal projection neurons and interneurons where they aggregate perisynaptically at asymmetric glutamatergic synapses and symmetric dopaminergic synaptic junctions. Moreover, they are also strongly expressed in the main body of symmetric synapses established by putative intrastriatal GABAergic terminals. In the globus pallidus, both receptor subtypes are found postsynaptically in the core of striatopallidal GABAergic synapses and perisynaptically at subthalamopallidal glutamatergic synapses. Finally, extrasynaptic labelling was commonly seen in the globus pallidus and the striatum. Moderate to intense GABA(B)R1 immunoreactivity was observed in the striatopallidal complex. At the electron microscope level, GABA(B)R1 immunostaining was commonly found in neuronal cell bodies and dendrites. Many striatal dendritic spines also displayed GABA(B)R1 immunoreactivity. Moreover, GABA(B)R1-immunoreactive axons and axon terminals were frequently encountered. In the striatum, GABA(B)R1-immunoreactive boutons resembled terminals of cortical origin, while in the globus pallidus, subthalamic-like terminals were labelled. Pre-embedding immunogold data showed that postsynaptic GABA(B)R1 receptors are concentrated at extrasynaptic sites on dendrites, spines and somata in the striatopallidal complex, perisynaptically at asymmetric synapses and in the main body of symmetric striatopallidal synapses in the GPe and GPi. Consistent with the immunoperoxidase data, immunoparticles were found in the presynaptic grid of asymmetric synapses established by cortical- and subthalamic-like glutamatergic terminals. These findings indicate that both GABA and glutamate metabotropic receptors are located to subserve various modulatory functions of the synaptic transmission in the primate striatopallidal complex. Furthermore, their pattern of localisation raises issues about their roles and mechanisms of activation in normal and pathological conditions. Because of their 'modulatory' functions, these receptors are ideal targets for chronic drug therapies in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease.",

    "title": "Clinical studies of three oral prodrugs of 5-fluorouracil (capecitabine, UFT, S-1): a review.",
    "abstract": "Although 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was first introduced in 1957, it remains an essential part of the treatment of a wide range of solid tumors. 5-FU has antitumor activity against epithelial malignancies arising in the gastrointestinal tract and breast as well as the head and neck, with single-agent response rates of only 10%-30%. Although 5-FU is still the most widely prescribed agent for the treatment of colorectal cancer, less than one-third of patients achieve objective responses. Recent research has focused on the biomodulation of 5-FU to improve the cytotoxicity and therapeutic effectiveness of this drug in the treatment of advanced disease. As all the anticancer agents, 5-FU leads to several toxicities. The toxicity profile of 5-FU is schedule dependent. Myelotoxicity is the major toxic effect in patients receiving bolus doses. Hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia), stomatitis, and neuro- and cardiotoxicities are associated with continuous infusions. Other adverse effects associated with both bolus-dose and continuous-infusion regimens include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, alopecia, and dermatitis. All these reasons explain the need for more effective and less toxic fluoropyrimidines. In the first part of this review, we briefly present the metabolic pathways of 5-FU responsible for the efficacy and toxicity of this drug. This knowledge is also necessary to understand the target(s) of biomodulation. The second part is devoted to a review of the literature on three recent prodrugs of 5-FU, i.e., capecitabine, UFT (ftorafur [FTO] plus uracil), and S-1 (FTO plus 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine plus potassium oxonate). The pharmacological principles that have influenced the development of these new drugs and our current knowledge of the clinical pharmacology of these new agents, focusing on antitumor activity and toxicity, are presented. The literature was analyzed until March 2002. This review is intended to be as exhaustive as possible since it was conceived as a work tool for readers wanting to go further.",

    "title": "The retinoids and cancer prevention mechanisms.",
    "abstract": "Carcinogenesis is a multistep process that converts normal cells into malignant cells. Once transformed, malignant cells acquire the ability to invade and metastasize, leading to clinically evident disease. During this continuum from normal to metastatic cells, carcinogenic steps can be arrested or reversed through pharmacological treatments, known as cancer chemoprevention. Chemoprevention strategies represent therapeutic interventions at early stages of carcinogenesis, before the onset of invasive cancer. Effective chemoprevention should reduce or avoid the clinical consequences of overt malignancies by treating early neoplastic lesions before development of clinically apparent signs or symptoms. Preclinical, clinical, and epidemiological data provide considerable support for cancer chemoprevention as an attractive therapeutic strategy. This clinical approach was validated in the recent tamoxifen randomized trial, demonstrating that a selective estrogen receptor modulator reduces the risk of breast cancer in women at high risk for this malignancy. Derivatives of vitamin A, the retinoids, have reported activity in treating specific premalignant lesions and reducing incidence of second primary tumors in patients with prior head and neck, lung or liver cancers. Whether the retinoids will prevent primary cancers at these sites is not yet known. Notably, a carotenoid (beta-carotene) was shown as inactive in primary prevention of lung cancers in high-risk individuals. This underscores the need for relevant in vitro models to identify pathways signaling chemopreventive effects. These models should assess the activity of candidate chemoprevention agents before the conduct of large and costly prevention trials. An improved understanding of cancer prevention mechanisms should aid in the discovery of new therapeutic targets and chemoprevention agents. Ideally, these agents should have tolerable clinical toxicities suitable for chronic administration to individuals at high risk for developing primary or second cancers. This article reviews what is now known from clinical and preclinical studies about the retinoids as cancer prevention agents.",

    "title": "Update on HER-2 as a target for cancer therapy: herceptin in the clinical setting.",
    "abstract": "Herceptin is the first therapy for breast cancer which targets an oncogene product. This humanized antibody to HER-2 has been shown to have activity as a single agent in a phase II trial of heavily pre-treated patients with advanced breast cancer and, in phase III studies, its use with chemotherapy is associated with higher response rates, longer time to progression and improved survival when compared with chemotherapy alone. Retrospective analysis of data from these pivotal trials suggests that attributable benefit of herceptin is greater in those patients who express HER-2 at the highest levels, that is 3+ expression by immunohistochemistry. Further analysis also implies that cases which are positive for HER-2 by fluorescent in situ hybridization may also benefit from treatment regardless of whether they express HER-2 at the 2+ or 3+ level. Use of herceptin as first-line therapy for metastatic disease in early studies suggest that response rates and clinical benefit rate similar to chemotherapy may be achievable and that survival using this sequential approach may not be compromized. Other combinations of herceptin and chemotherapy have been investigated with phase II data suggesting considerable activity with weekly taxol and when combined with navelbine. The non-linear pharmacokinetics of herceptin suggest that, as doses increased, half-life increases and may be feasible on a 3-weekly schedule. The role of herceptin in the adjuvant setting in the management of breast cancer will be tested in randomized studies of patients who express HER-2 at the highest levels; two of these studies have already begun.",

    "title": "beta-lactam resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae: penicillin-binding proteins and non-penicillin-binding proteins.",
    "abstract": "The beta-lactams are by far the most widely used and efficacious of all antibiotics. Over the past few decades, however, widespread resistance has evolved among most common pathogens. Streptococcus pneumoniae has become a paradigm for understanding the evolution of resistance mechanisms, the simplest of which, by far, is the production of beta-lactamases. As these enzymes are frequently plasmid encoded, resistance can readily be transmitted between bacteria. Despite the fact that pneumococci are naturally transformable organisms, no beta-lactamase-producing strain has yet been described. A much more complex resistance mechanism has evolved in S. pneumoniae that is mediated by a sophisticated restructuring of the targets of the beta-lactams, the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs); however, this may not be the whole story. Recently, a third level of resistance mechanisms has been identified in laboratory mutants, wherein non-PBP genes are mutated and resistance development is accompanied by deficiency in genetic transformation. Two such non-PBP genes have been described: a putative glycosyltransferase, CpoA, and a histidine protein kinase, CiaH. We propose that these non-PBP genes are involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall components at a step prior to the biosynthetic functions of PBPs, and that the mutations selected during beta-lactam treatment counteract the effects caused by the inhibition of penicillin-binding proteins.",

    "abstract": "Gender-based differences in the incidence of hypertensive and coronary artery disease, the development of atherosclerosis, and myocardial remodeling after infarction are attributable to the indirect effect of estrogen on risk factor profiles, such as cholesterol levels, glucose metabolism, and insulin levels. More recent evidence, however, suggests that activated estrogen receptor (ER) mediates signaling cascades that culminate in direct protective effects such as vasodilation, inhibition of response to vessel injury, limiting myocardial injury after infarction, and attenuating cardiac hypertrophy. Although the ER is usually thought of as a ligand-dependent transcription factor, it can also rapidly mobilize signals at the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm. Thus, a greater understanding of ER function and regulation may lead to the development of highly specific therapeutics that mediate the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",

    "title": "Interference by toxic metal ions with DNA repair processes and cell cycle control: molecular mechanisms.",
    "abstract": "Nickel, cadmium, cobalt, and arsenic compounds are well-known carcinogens to humans and experimental animals. Even though their DNA-damaging potentials are rather weak, they interfere with the nucleotide and base excision repair at low, noncytotoxic concentrations. For example, both water-soluble Ni(II) and particulate black NiO greatly reduced the repair of DNA adducts induced by benzo[a]pyrene, an important environmental pollutant. Furthermore, Ni(II), As(III), and Co(II) interfered with cell cycle progression and cell cycle control in response to ultraviolet C radiation. As potential molecular targets, interactions with so-called zinc finger proteins involved in DNA repair and/or DNA damage signaling were investigated. We observed an inactivation of the bacterial formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg), the mammalian xeroderma pigmentosum group A protein (XPA), and the poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose)polymerase (PARP). Although all proteins were inhibited by Cd(II) and Cu(II), XPA and PARP but not Fpg were inhibited by Co(II) and Ni(II). As(III) deserves special attention, as it inactivated only PARP, but did so at very low concentrations starting from 10 nM. Because DNA is permanently damaged by endogenous and environmental factors, functioning processing of DNA lesions is an important prerequisite for maintaining genomic integrity; its inactivation by metal compounds may therefore constitute an important mechanism of metal-related carcinogenicity.",

    "abstract": "The termination of neurotransmission is achieved by rapid uptake of the released neurotransmitter by specific high-affinity neurotransmitter transporters. Most of these transporters are encoded by a family of genes (Na+/Cl- transporters) having a similar membrane topography of 12 transmembrane helices. An evolutionary tree revealed five distinct subfamilies: gamma-aminobutyric acid transporters, monoamine transporters, amino acid transporters, \"orphan\" transporters, and the recently discovered bacterial transporters. The bacterial transporters that belong to this family may help to develop heterologous expression systems with the aim of solving the three-dimensional structure of these membrane proteins. Some of the neurotransmitter transporters have been implicated as important sites for drug action. Monoamine transporters, for example, are targeted by major classes of antidepressants, psychostimulants, and antihypertensive drugs. Localization of individual transporters in specific cells and brain areas is pertinent to understanding their contribution to neurotransmission and their potential as targets for drugs. The most important questions in the field include resolving the mechanism of neurotransmitter transport, the structure of the transporters, and the interaction of each transporter in complex neurological activities.",

Their ligand-dependent activity makes nuclear receptors obvious targets for drug design in many therapeutic areas. Crystallographic studies have revealed the structure of isolated domains but not, yet, of a whole protein, probably due to an intrinsic flexibility at work in nuclear receptor action. The structure of DNA-binding domain dimers in complex with an oligonucleotide has brought insights into how nuclear receptors recognize and bind to their target sequences ('response elements'). The structure of several ligand-binding domains in different ligation states has provided evidence for a ligand-dependent transcriptional switch and a molecular basis for the mode of action of agonists and antagonists.",

    "title": "Signalling via caveolin: involvement in the cross-talk between phosphoinositolglycans and insulin.",
    "abstract": "In recent years, a number of cross-talk systems have been identified which feed into the insulin signalling cascade at the level of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) tyrosine phosphorylation, e.g., receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled receptors. At the molecular level, a number of negative modulator and feedback systems somehow interacting with the beta-subunit (catecholamine-, phorbolester-, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced serine/threonine phosphorylation, carboxy-terminal trimming by a thiol-dependent protease, association of inhibitory/regulatory proteins such as RAD, PC1, PED, alpha2-HS-glycoprotein) have been identified as candidate mechanisms for the impairment of insulin receptor function by elevations in the activity and/or amount of the corresponding modification enzymes/inhibitors. Both decreased responsiveness and sensitivity of the insulin receptor beta-subunit for insulin-induced tyrosine autophosphorylation have been demonstrated in several cellular and animal models of metabolic insulin resistance as well as in the adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of diabetic patients and obese Pima Indians compared to non-obese subjects. Therefore, induction of the insulin signalling cascade by bypassing the defective insulin receptor kinase may be useful for the therapy of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. During the past two decades, phosphoinositolglycans (PIGs) of various origin have been demonstrated to exert potent insulin-mimetic metabolic effects upon incubation with cultured or isolated muscle and adipose cells. However, it remained to be elucidated whether these compounds actually manage to trigger insulin signalling and if so at which level of hierarchy within the signalling cascade the site of interference is located. Recent studies using isolated rat adipocytes and chemically synthesized PIG compounds point to IRS1/3 tyrosine phosphorylation by p59Lyn kinase as the site of cross-talk, the negative regulation of which by interaction with caveolin is apparently abrogated by PIG. This putative mechanism is thus compatible with the recently formulated caveolin signalling hypothesis, the supporting data for which are reviewed here. Though we have not obtained experimental evidence for the involvement of PIG in physiological insulin action, the potential cross-talk between insulin and PIG signalling, including the caveolae/detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched rafts as the compartments where the corresponding signalling components are concentrated, thus represent novel targets for signal transduction therapy.",

    "abstract": "In this review, we present evidence for the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission in cerebral ischemia-induced neuronal death. While glutamate neurotransmission has received widespread attention in this area of study, relatively few investigators have focused on the ischemia-induced alterations in inhibitory neurotransmission. We present a review of the effects of cerebral ischemia on pre and postsynaptic targets within the GABAergic synapse. Both in vitro and in vivo models of ischemia have been used to measure changes in GABA synthesis, release, reuptake, GABA(A) receptor expression and activity. Cellular events generated by ischemia that have been shown to alter GABA neurotransmission include changes in the Cl(-) gradient, reduction in ATP, increase in intracellular Ca(2+), generation of reactive oxygen species, and accumulation of arachidonic acid and eicosanoids. Neuroprotective strategies to increase GABA neurotransmission target both sides of the synapse as well, by preventing GABA reuptake and metabolism and increasing GABA(A) receptor activity with agonists and allosteric modulators. Some of these strategies are quite efficacious in animal models of cerebral ischemia, with sedation as the only unwanted side-effect. Based on promising animal data, clinical trials with GABAergic drugs are in progress for specific types of stroke. This review attempts to provide an understanding of the mechanisms by which GABA neurotransmission is sensitive to cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, we discuss how dysfunction of GABA neurotransmission may contribute to neuronal death and how neuronal death can be prevented by GABAergic drugs.",

The interest of researchers for PPARs increased dramatically when these receptors were shown to be directly activated by a number of medically relevant compounds. These compounds include: the fibrate class of hypolidemic drugs, the thiazolidinediones, which are insulin sensitizers used as orally active antidiabetic agents, certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and naturally occurring fatty acid-derived molecules. Rapidly, it was demonstrated that PPARs are key regulators of lipid homeostasis and provide a molecular link between nutrition and gene regulation. Recently, detailed studies of PPAR expression profiles in different tissues pointed to the roles these receptors play in inflammation control and cell proliferation. In this review we will focus on the new insights gained into these two areas and we will also discuss our current knowledge of the regulation of PPAR transcriptional activity by cofactors.",

These properties have raised the possibility of its use as a therapeutic agent in cancer. Our recent studies using stereoisomers of the A-ring of monohydroxylated 19-nor or 2-methyl substituted 1 alpha,25 (OH)2D3 have clearly demonstrated that the A-ring analogs that contain 1 alpha-hydroxy or 3 beta-hydroxy group are potent inducers of HL-60 cell differentiation. In contrast, the A-ring analogs that contain 1 beta-hydroxy or 3 alpha-hydroxy group are potent stimulators of HL-60 cell apoptosis. It was interesting to note that the analogs could induce differentiation or apoptosis of HL-60 cells on the basis of the stereochemistry of both hydroxy groups at positions 1 and 3 of the A-ring. To further elucidate the possible roles of both the hydroxy groups in regulating cell differentiation and apoptosis, we have synthesized all possible diastereomers of the A-ring of 1 alpha,25 (OH)2D3 and examined their molecular mechanism of differentiation and apoptosis-inducing actions of HL-60 cells in vitro. This study shows that differentiation and apoptosis of HL-60 cells are strictly controlled by the stereochemistry of both hydroxy groups at positions 1 and 3 of the A-ring of 1 alpha,25 (OH)2D3, and the proteins responsible for the regulation of cell cycle and mitochondrial membrane potential are the major targets of 1 alpha,25 (OH)2D3 analogs. These findings provide useful information not only for structure-function studies of 1 alpha,25 (OH)2D3 analogs but also for the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer.",

    "title": "Molecular mechanism of action of fluoride on bone cells.",
    "abstract": "Fluoride is an effective anabolic agent to increase spinal bone density by increasing bone formation, and at therapeutically relevant (i.e., micromolar) concentrations, it stimulates bone cell proliferation and activities in vitro and in vivo. However, the fluoride therapy of osteoporosis has been controversial, in large part because of a lack of consistent antifracture efficacy. However, information regarding the molecular mechanism of action of fluoride may improve its optimum and correct usage and may disclose potential targets for the development of new second generation drugs that might have a better efficacy and safety profile. Accordingly, this review will address the molecular mechanisms of the osteogenic action of fluoride. In this regard, we and other workers have proposed two competing models, both of which involve the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) mitogenic signal transduction pathway. Our model involves a fluoride inhibition of a unique fluoride-sensitive phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP) in osteoblasts, which results in a sustained increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation level of the key signaling proteins of the MAPK mitogenic transduction pathway, leading to the potentiation of the bone cell proliferation initiated by growth factors. The competing model proposes that fluoride acts in coordination with aluminum to form fluoroaluminate, which activates a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o protein on bone cell membrane, leading to an activation of cellular protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), which in turn leads to increases in the tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling proteins of the MAPK mitogenic signal transduction pathway, ultimately leading to a stimulation of cell proliferation. A benefit of our model, but not the other model, is that it accounts for all the unique properties of the osteogenic action of fluoride. These include the low effective fluoride dose, the skeletal tissue specificity, the requirement of PTK-activating growth factors, the sensitivity to changes in medium phosphate concentration, the preference for undifferentiated osteoblasts, and the involvement of the MAPK. Unlike fluoride, the mitogenic action of fluoroaluminate is not specific for skeletal cells. Moreover, the mitogenic action of fluoroaluminate shows several important, different characteristics than that of fluoride. Thus, it is likely that our model of a fluoride-sensitive PTP represents the actual molecular mechanism of the osteogenic action of fluoride.",

    "title": "Perspectives for TNF-alpha-targeting therapies.",
    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common chronic autoimmunopathy, clinically leading to joint destruction as a consequence of the chronic inflammatory processes. The pathogenesis of this disabling disease is not well understood, but molecular events leading to tissue inflammation with cartilage and bone destruction are now better defined. Therapy with slow-acting, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as low-dose methotrexate, which is generally accepted as a standard, leads to a significant amelioration of symptoms but does not stop joint destruction. Due to these disappointing treatment options and the identification of certain inflammatory mediators as therapeutic targets, novel therapeutic agents such as monoclonal antibodies, cytokine-receptor/human-immunoglobulin constructs or recombinant human proteins have been tested in RA with some success. Clinical trials testing anti-TNF-alpha agents, alone or in combination with methotrexate, have convincingly shown the feasibility and efficacy of these novel approaches to the therapy of RA. A clinical trial testing combination therapy with chimeric (mouse/human) anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody infliximab and methotrexate showed, for the first time in any RA trial, that there was no median radiological progression in the groups given infliximab plus methotrexate over a 12-month observation period. Similar encouraging results might arise from trials employing other TNF-alpha-directed agents, such as the fully human monoclonal antibody D2E7, the p75 TNF-alpha-receptor/Ig construct, etanercept, or others, as discussed in this review. Combination partners other than methotrexate will be established as suitable cotreatment along with anti-TNF-alpha biologicals. Forthcoming new indications for TNF-alpha-targeted therapies are discussed.",

    "abstract": "During the past ten years, the improvements of our understanding of cellular signal transduction pathways provide new targets for drug therapies. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a malignant hematopoietic stem cell disorder, is characterised by an acquired genetic abnormality: the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) and its molecular counterpart, the oncogene BCR-ABL. The latter, which is translated in an active BCR-ABL protein, exhibited a deregulated tyrosine kinase activity inducing malignant transformation. Produced from the 2-phenylaminopyrimidine class, a novel synthetic inhibitor, identified as CGP57148 (STI571), inhibits tyrosine kinase activity of c-ABL, BCR-ABL, PDGF-R and c-kit at micromolar concentrations. It suppresses the proliferation of the majority of BCR-ABL positive cell lines. The phases I-II clinical trials in CML have demonstrated promising results, especially in the chronic phase of the disease. STI571 is an original therapeutic approach which may be used as a model for the development of other drugs in cancer.",

Rev Cardiovasc Med. 2003 Summer;4(3):188-91.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe administered with simvastatin in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of statins, many patients do not achieve lipid targets. Combination therapy with lipid-lowering agents that act via a complementary pathway may allow additional patients to achieve recommended cholesterol goals.METHODS: After dietary stabilization, a 2- to 12-week washout period, and a 4-week, single-blind, placebo lead-in period, patients with baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) > or =145 mg/dl to < or =250 mg/dl and triglycerides (TG) < or =350 mg/dl were randomized to one of the following 10 groups administered daily for 12 consecutive weeks: ezetimibe 10 mg; simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; or placebo. The primary efficacy variable was percentage reduction from baseline to end point in direct LDL-C for the pooled ezetimibe plus simvastatin groups versus pooled simvastatin groups.RESULTS: Ezetimibe plus simvastatin significantly improved LDL-C (p < 0.01), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (p = 0.03), and TG (p < 0.01) compared with simvastatin alone. Ezetimibe plus simvastatin (pooled doses) provided an incremental 13.8% LDL-C reduction, 2.4% HDL-C increase, and 7.5% TG reduction compared with pooled simvastatin alone. Coadministration of ezetimibe and simvastatin provided LDL-C reductions of 44% to 57%, TG reductions of 20% to 28%, and HDL-C increases of 8% to 11%, depending on the simvastatin dose. Ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 10 mg and simvastatin 80 mg alone each provided a 44% LDL-C reduction. The coadministration of ezetimibe with simvastatin was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to those of simvastatin and of placebo.CONCLUSIONS: When coadministered with simvastatin, ezetimibe provided significant incremental reductions in LDL-C and TG, as well as increases in HDL-C. Coadministration of ezetimibe with simvastatin was well tolerated and comparable to statin alone.",

    "title": "Comparative aspects of the function and mechanism of SUR1 and MDR1 proteins.",
    "abstract": "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily proteins have divergent functions and can be classified as transporters, channels, and receptors, although their predicted secondary structures are very much alike. Prominent members include the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1) and the multidrug transporter (MDR1). SUR1 is a subunit of the pancreatic beta-cell K(ATP) channel and plays a key role in the regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion. SUR1 binds ATP at NBF1, and ADP at NBF2 and the two NBFs work cooperatively. The pore-forming subunit of the pancreatic beta-cell K(ATP) channel, Kir6.2, is a member of the inwardly rectifying K(+) channel family, and also binds ATP. In this article, we present a model in which the activity of the K(ATP) channel is determined by the balance of the action of ADP, which activates the channel through SUR1, and the action of ATP, which stabilizes the long closed state by binding to Kir6.2. The concentration of ATP could also affect the channel activity through binding to NBF1 of SUR1. MDR1, on the other hand, is an ATP-dependent efflux pump which extrudes cytotoxic drugs from cells before they can reach their intracellular targets, and in this way confers multidrug resistance to cancer cells. Both NBFs of MDR1 can hydrolyze nucleotides, and their ATPase activity is necessary for drug transport. The interaction of SUR1 with nucleotides is quite different from that of MDR1. Variations in the interactions with nucleotides of ABC proteins may account for the differences in their functions.",

    "abstract": "Animal studies indicate that the immune system is one of the most sensitive targets of the toxic effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-p-dibenzodioxin (TCDD). TCDD inhibits immunoglobulin secretion and decreases resistance to bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections in exposed animals. Nearly 20 years after the Seveso, Italy, accident, we measured immunoglobulin and complement plasma levels in a random sample of the population in the most highly exposed zones (n = 62) and in the surrounding noncontaminated area (n = 58). Plasma IgG levels decreased with increasing TCDD plasma concentration (r = -0.35, p = 0.0002). Median IgG concentration decreased from 1,526 mg/dL in the group with the lowest (< 3.5 ppt) TCDD levels to 1,163 mg/dL in the group with the highest (20.1-89.9 ppt) TCDD levels (p = 0.002). The association was significant (p = 0.0004) after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and consumption of domestic livestock and poultry in multiple regression analysis and persisted after exclusion of subjects with inflammatory diseases and those using antibiotics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. IgM, IgA, C3, and C4 plasma concentrations did not exhibit any consistent association with TCDD levels. We performed a systematic review of all the articles published between 1966 and 2001 on human subjects exposed to TCDD reporting information on circulating levels of immunoglobulins and/or complement components. The literature indicates that the evidence for effects of TCDD on humoral immunity is sparse. Methodologic issues, results, and possible sources of variation between studies are discussed. The possible long-term immunologic effects of TCDD exhibited by the participants of the present study, coupled with the increased incidence of lymphatic tumors in the area of the accident, warrant further investigation.",

    "title": "Role of prolactin and growth hormone on thymus physiology.",
    "abstract": "Intrathymic T-cell differentiation is under the control of the thymic microenvironment, which acts on maturing thymocytes via membrane as well as soluble products. Increasing data show that this process can be modulated by classical hormones, as exemplified herein by prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH), largely secreted by the pituitary gland. Both PRL and GH stimulate the secretion of thymulin, a thymic hormone produced by thymic epithelial cells. Conversely, low levels of circulating thymulin parallel hypopituitary states. Interestingly, the enhancing effects of GH on thymulin seem to be mediated by insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1) since they can be abrogated with anti-IGF-1 or anti-IGF-1-receptor antibodies. The influence of PRL and GH on the thymic epithelium is pleiotropic: PRL enhances in vivo the expression of high-molecular-weight cytokeratins and stimulates in vitro TEC proliferation, an effect that is shared by GH and IGF-1. Differentiating T cells are also targets for the intrathymic action of PRL and GH. In vivo inoculation of a rat pituitary cell line into old rats results in restoration of the thymus, including differentiation of CD4- CD8- thymocytes into CD4+ CD8+ cells. Furthermore, PRL may regulate the maintenance of thymocyte viability during the double-positive stage of thymocyte differentiation. Injections of GH into aging mice increase total thymocyte numbers and the percentage of CD3-bearing cells, as well as the Concanavalin-A mitogenic response and IL-6 production by thymocytes. Interestingly, similar findings are observed in animals treated with IGF-1. Lastly, the thymic hypoplasia observed in dwarf mice can be reversed with GH treatment. In keeping with the data summarized earlier is the detection of receptors for PRL and GH on both thymocytes and thymic epithelial cells. Importantly, recent studies indicate that both cell types can produce PRL and GH intrathymically. Similarly, production of IGF-1 and expression of a corresponding receptor has also been demonstrated. In conclusion, these data strongly indicate that the thymus is physiologically under control of pituitary hormones PRL and GH. In addition to the classical endocrine pathway, paracrine and autocrine circuits are probably implicated in such control.",

    "title": "Interaction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with the human multidrug transporter proteins, MDR1 and MRP1.",
    "abstract": "Specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are rapidly developing clinical tools applied for the inhibition of malignant cell growth and metastasis formation. Most of these newly developed TKI molecules are hydrophobic, thus rapidly penetrate the cell membranes to reach intracellular targets. However, a large number of tumor cells overexpress multidrug transporter membrane proteins, which efficiently extrude hydrophobic drugs and thus may prevent the therapeutic action of TKIs. In the present work, we demonstrate that the most abundant and effective cancer multidrug transporters, MDR1 and MRP1, directly interact with several TKIs under drug development or already in clinical trials. This interaction with the transporters does not directly correlate with the hydrophobicity or molecular structure of TKIs, and shows a large variability in transporter selectivity and affinity. We suggest that performing enzyme- and cell-based multidrug transporter interaction tests for TKIs may greatly facilitate drug development, and allow the prediction of clinical TKI resistance based on this mechanism. Moreover, diagnostics for the expression of specific multidrug transporters in the malignant cells, combined with information on the interactions of the drug transporter proteins with TKIs, should allow a highly effective, individualized clinical treatment for cancer patients.",

    "title": "Inflammation and CFTR: might neutrophils be the key in cystic fibrosis?",
    "abstract": "The aim of this hypothesis is to provide new insights into the still unclear mechanisms governing airway inflammation in cystic fibrosis. Although the genetic basis of cystic fibrosis as well as the molecular structure of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), the mutated protein which causes the disease, have been well defined, a clear relationship between the genetic defect and the pulmonary pathophysiology, especially chronic infections and neutrophil-dominated airway inflammation has not been established. Cystic fibrosis is thus a unique pathological situation in that neutrophils can be depicted as both an antiinfectious and a proinflammatory cell. In cystic fibrosis there is an emerging picture of an imbalance between these two roles with both a reduction in the antiinfectious efficacy and an augmentation of the proinflammatory functions. Better knowledge of fundamental defects in neutrophil function in cystic fibrosis as well as a novel cellular function of CFTR, which will be reviewed, will allow identification of potentially new clinical targets and aid selective therapeutic action aimed at counteracting the lethal neutrophil-induced airway inflammation. The rationale for colchicine therapy is a significant example of a drug which might act both at the molecular levels on CFTR expression in epithelial cells and on neutrophils to mediate antiinflammatory effects. Preliminary results are presented in this issue (Med Inflamm 1999; 8: 13-15).",

    "abstract": "Rapid progress in deciphering the biological mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has arisen from the application of molecular and cell biology to this complex disorder of the limbic and association cortices. In turn, new insights into fundamental aspects of protein biology have resulted from research on the disease. This beneficial interplay between basic and applied cell biology is well illustrated by advances in understanding the genotype-to-phenotype relationships of familial Alzheimer's disease. All four genes definitively linked to inherited forms of the disease to date have been shown to increase the production and/or deposition of amyloid beta-protein in the brain. In particular, evidence that the presenilin proteins, mutations in which cause the most aggressive form of inherited AD, lead to altered intramembranous cleavage of the beta-amyloid precursor protein by the protease called gamma-secretase has spurred progress toward novel therapeutics. The finding that presenilin itself may be the long-sought gamma-secretase, coupled with the recent identification of beta-secretase, has provided discrete biochemical targets for drug screening and development. Alternate and novel strategies for inhibiting the early mechanism of the disease are also emerging. The progress reviewed here, coupled with better ability to diagnose the disease early, bode well for the successful development of therapeutic and preventative drugs for this major public health problem.",

    "abstract": "Our introduction of the molecular correlation concept and the key enzyme concept and the use of biologically meaningful tumor models and control systems resulted in the discovery of an ordered pattern of enzymic and metabolic imbalance and the elucidation of the linkage with transformation and progression. We showed that the biochemical and enzymic pattern of alterations was the result of a reprogramming of gene expression that was both quantitative and qualitative and was characteristic to neoplasia, since no similar pattern of imbalance was observed in any of the control normal, regenerating, or differentiating tissues. Important aspects of gene logic were identified. These include demonstration of operation of reciprocal control of activities of opposing key enzymes and antagonistic pathways of synthesis and catabolism in pyrimidine, purine, ornithine, and carbohydrate metabolism and recently in signal transduction. The extent of increase in the activities of key enzymes of pyrimidine and purine biosynthesis related to the absolute activity of the enzymes in resting liver. The qualitative alterations in gene expression included the isozyme shift of key regulatory enzymes. We identified a segment of gene expression that is essential for neoplasia. We pointed out the selective advantages that reprogramming of gene expression confers to cancer cells. Understanding these alterations in the enzymology and biochemistry of cancer cells made it possible to identify potentially sensitive targets for anticancer chemotherapy. In recent clinical studies we targeted the increased IMP dehydrogenase activity in leukemic blast cells by an inhibitor drug, tiazofurin, and achieved 77% responses, including complete remissions.",

    "abstract": "The collecting duct is one of the major targets for aldosterone's action. Experiments conducted several years ago suggested that the major site of action on Na+ and K+ transport was the cortical portion, the cortical collecting duct (CCD). Subsequent studies have shown that the entire collecting duct is capable of responding to aldosterone, but does so differently according to the region. The inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD), while exhibiting a relatively low rate of Na+ transport in isolated, perfused tubules, can develop substantial rates of Na+ transport when put in primary culture. The IMCD, in contrast to the CCD, usually secretes little K+. Investigations into the mechanisms for the lower rates of Na+ transport have revealed that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which is endogenously produced in the inner medulla, can markedly reduce the natriferric action of aldosterone. This action of TGF-beta is not apparent within the first few hours of exposure, but its effects, even after removal, last for over 48 hours. The mechanism of this antagonism appears to involve pathways that are parallel and independent of the major transcriptional effects of aldosterone.",

    "title": "Recent advances in GABAB receptors: from pharmacology to molecular biology.",
    "abstract": "Bicuculline-insensitive receptors for the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), GABAB receptors, are a distinct subclass of receptors that mediate depression of synaptic transmission and contribute to neuronal inhibition. When activated, these receptors reduce transmission at excitatory and inhibitory synapses, as a result of an increase in K+ conductance, or a decrease in voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents. They are also linked to G-proteins, or intracellular effector systems in a very complex manner. The recent development of highly specific and potent agonists and antagonists for these receptors has led to a much better understanding of their physiology and pharmacology, including their heterogeneity, as well as their molecular biology. Over the past year, expression and cloning studies have contributed to major advances in characterizing GABAB receptor structure, with the discovery of the amino acid sequences of GABABR1a/R1b splice variants and GABABR2 receptors. These isoforms are widely distributed throughout the nervous system, and can be functionally expressed. Importantly, GABABR2 receptors can form a heteromeric assembly with GABABR1 proteins to operate as a heterodimer that displays robust coupling to inward-rectifying K+ channels, as well as inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Further insights underlying the mechanisms of GABAB receptor functions can now be gained, leading ultimately to the therapeutic potential of drugs acting at these sites. It is increasingly clear that new information on GABAB receptor molecular structure will provide a plethora of targets for pharmaceutical intervention in areas such as drug addiction, nociception and absence seizures. This review summarizes the renewed efforts, and highlights the recent advances emerging in this field.",

    "title": "Dose response relation to oral theophylline in severe chronic obstructive airways disease.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate measurement of the trapped gas volume as a measure of respiratory function in patients with chronic obstructive airways disease and their response to treatment with theophylline.DESIGN: Patients able to produce consistent results on testing of respiratory function spent two weeks having dosage of theophylline adjusted to give individual pharmacokinetic data. This was followed by random assignment to four consecutive two month treatment periods--placebo and low, medium, and high dose, as assessed by serum concentrations of theophylline. Respiratory function and exercise performance was assessed at the end of each two month period.SETTING: Chest unit in district hospital.PATIENTS: Thirty eight patients with chronic bronchitis and moderate to severe chronic obstruction to airflow were recruited; 33 aged 53-73 years completed the study.INTERVENTIONS: Dosage of oral theophylline increased during two week optimisation period to 800 mg daily unless toxicity was predicted, when 400 mg was given. Targets for the steady state serum theophylline concentrations were 5-10 mg/l in the low dose period, 10-15 mg/l in the medium dose, and 15-20 mg/l in the high dose period.ENDPOINTS: Respiratory function as measured by forced expiratory volume in one second, forced vital capacity, peak expiratory flow rate, slow vital capacity, and static lung volumes using helium dilution and body plethysmography from which trapped gas volume was derived. Exercise performance assessed by six minute walking test and diary cards using visual analogue scale.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The forced expiratory volume in one second, forced vital capacity, and peak expiratory flow rate changed only slightly (about 13%) over the range of doses. There was a linear dose dependent fall of trapped gas volume from 1.84 l (SE 0.157) to 1.42 l (0.152), 1.05 l (0.128), and 0.67 l (0.102) during the placebo and low, medium, and high dose treatment periods. Mean walking distance increased by up to 55.6 m (20%). There was a modest improvement in dyspnoea as the dose of theophylline was increased. Side effects were mostly minor but they became more frequent as the dose was increased.CONCLUSION: The fall in trapped gas volume may reflect an improvement in peripheral ventilation (associated with treatment with theophylline) which is less apparent in the more common tests of lung function used in patients with chronic obstructive airways disease.",

    "title": "Comprehensive management of patients with type 2 diabetes: establishing priorities of care.",
    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose levels and a marked increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The increased CVD risk is caused by a unique cluster of metabolic abnormalities, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia. To reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes, comprehensive management of risk factors is essential. Aggressive treatment of dyslipidemia and hypertension is known to benefit patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, intensive glycemic control and targeted treatment of insulin resistance can further reduce the enormous burden of CVD in this high-risk population. Increasing evidence suggests that insulin resistance is one of the earliest markers of risk for both CVD and diabetes, and it is known that insulin resistance alone can significantly increase the risk of CVD. Type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance are both associated with disordered lipid metabolism, manifest in elevated triglyceride levels, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and small, dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol particles. Patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance have an increased risk of hypertension, which further contributes to their CVD risk. Each of these factors can also contribute to the risk of microvascular disease. To ensure that patients with type 2 diabetes receive comprehensive, high-quality care, specific standards have been developed. These standards can help providers establish clear treatment targets, identify specific priorities of care, and use therapies of known efficacy to reduce the risk of complications. This review summarizes the current standards of care for patients with type 2 diabetes, with an emphasis on treatments that reduce the cardiovascular risk factors. Using a case study approach, it reviews the essential components of diabetes care and proposes a rational approach to these complex cases--an approach that should result in consistent, high-quality care.",

    "title": "Preoperative chemoradiation for locally advanced rectal cancer: emerging treatment strategies.",
    "abstract": "Over the past decade, patients with locally advanced rectal cancer at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center have been managed with preoperative chemoradiation. Patients achieving a complete clinical response to preoperative chemoradiation have had better pelvic tumor control, sphincterpreservation, and overall survival than those with gross residual disease. Some patients achieving a complete clinical response have even had rectal-preserving surgery (full-thickness local excision). These results emphasize the importance of maximizing tumor response. Further improvement in response and survival could be achieved by using novel chemotherapeutic agents or through tumor-selective molecular targeting strategies that enhance the effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both. Irinotecan (CPT-11, Camptosar) is a novel chemotherapy agent being evaluated clinically as a radiosensitizing agent in rectal cancer. Inhibition of several molecular targets-such as epidermal growth factor receptor, ras oncogene activation, the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, and neoangiogenesis-appears to be tumor-selective in preclinical models. COX-2 expression has been shown to enhance cytotoxic therapy in preclinical models. In vitro and in vivo studies show that selective COX-2 inhibition enhances the effects of radiotherapy as well as chemotherapy. COX-2 is also markedly upregulated in human colorectal cancer and appears to be associated with adverse patient prognosis. Thus, integration of molecular targeting, such as COX-2 selective inhibition with existing chemoradiation approaches, may provide selective tumor radiosensitization and chemosensitization, resulting in improved pelvic control, sphincter preservation, and overall survival.",

Arch Dermatol. 2002 Sep;138(9):1238-40. doi: 10.1001/archderm.138.9.1238.BACKGROUND: Psoriatic plaques are characterized by infiltration with CD4+ CD45RO+ and CD8+ CD45RO+ memory effector T lymphocytes. The recombinant protein alefacept binds to CD2 on memory effector T lymphocytes, inhibiting their activation.METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, we evaluated alefacept as a treatment for psoriasis. Two hundred twenty-nine patients with chronic psoriasis received intravenous alefacept (0.025, 0.075, or 0.150 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo weekly for 12 weeks, with follow-up for 12 additional weeks. Before treatment, the median scores on the psoriasis area-and-severity index were between 14 and 20 in all groups (0 denotes no psoriasis and 72 the most severe disease possible).RESULTS: Alefacept was well tolerated and nonimmunogenic. The mean reduction in the score on the psoriasis area-and-severity index two weeks after treatment was greater in the alefacept groups (38, 53, and 53 percent in the groups receiving 0.025, 0.075, and 0.150 mg per kilogram, respectively) than in the placebo group (21 percent, P<0.001). Twelve weeks after treatment, 28 patients who had received alefacept alone were clear or almost clear of psoriasis. Three patients in the placebo group were clear or almost clear; all three had received additional systemic therapy for psoriasis. Alefacept reduced peripheral-blood memory effector T-lymphocyte (CD45RO+) counts, and the reduction in the number of memory-effector T lymphocytes was correlated with the improvement in psoriasis.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with alefacept for 12 weeks is associated with improvement in chronic plaque psoriasis; some patients have a sustained clinical response after the cessation of treatment. Alefacept selectively targets CD45RO+ memory effector T lymphocytes, suggesting that they have a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.",

    "title": "Pesticides and inner-city children: exposures, risks, and prevention.",
    "abstract": "Six million children live in poverty in America's inner cities. These children are at high risk of exposure to pesticides that are used extensively in urban schools, homes, and day-care centers for control of roaches, rats, and other vermin. The organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos and certain pyrethroids are the registered pesticides most heavily applied in cities. Illegal street pesticides are also in use, including tres pasitos (a carbamate), tiza china, and methyl parathion. In New York State in 1997, the heaviest use of pesticides in all counties statewide was in the urban boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Children are highly vulnerable to pesticides. Because of their play close to the ground, their hand-to-mouth behavior, and their unique dietary patterns, children absorb more pesticides from their environment than adults. The long persistence of semivolatile pesticides such as chlorpyrifos on rugs, furniture, stuffed toys, and other absorbent surfaces within closed apartments further enhances urban children's exposures. Compounding these risks of heavy exposures are children's decreased ability to detoxify and excrete pesticides and the rapid growth, development, and differentiation of their vital organ systems. These developmental immaturities create early windows of great vulnerability. Recent experimental data suggest, for example, that chlorpyrifos may be a developmental neurotoxicant and that exposure in utero may cause biochemical and functional aberrations in fetal neurons as well as deficits in the number of neurons. Certain pyrethroids exert hormonal activity that may alter early neurologic and reproductive development. Assays currently used for assessment of the toxicity of pesticides are insensitive and cannot accurately predict effects to children exposed in utero or in early postnatal life. Protection of American children, and particularly of inner-city children, against the developmental hazards of pesticides requires a comprehensive strategy that monitors patterns of pesticide use on a continuing basis, assesses children's actual exposures to pesticides, uses state-of-the-art developmental toxicity testing, and establishes societal targets for reduction of pesticide use.",

Here we report the cloning and characterization of a t(11;20)(p15;q11) translocation from patients with t-MDS. The breakpoint on chromosome 11p15 targets the NUP98 gene and results in the separation of the N-terminal FXFG repeats from the RNA-binding domain located in the C-terminus. The breakpoint on chromosome 20q11 occurs within the gene encoding human DNA topoisomerase I (TOP1). As a result, a chimeric mRNA encoding the NUP98 FXFG repeats fused to the body of DNA topoisomerase I is produced. These results indicate that NUP98 is a recurrent target in therapy-related malignancies, and that TOP1 is a previously unrecognized target for chromosomal translocations.",

    "abstract": "Molecular subtypes of muscarinic receptors (m1-m5) are novel targets for cholinergic replacement therapies in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, knowledge concerning the relative distribution, abundance and functional status of these receptors in human brain and AD is incomplete. Recent data from our laboratory have demonstrated a defect in the ability of the M1 receptor subtype to form a high affinity agonist-receptor-G protein complex in AD frontal cortex. This defect is manifested by decreased M1 receptor-stimulated GTPgammaS binding and GTPase activity and by a loss in receptor-stimulated phospholipase C activity. Normal levels of G proteins suggest that the aberrant receptor-G protein interaction may result from an altered form of the m1 receptor in AD. The combined use of radioligand binding and receptor-domain specific antibodies has permitted the re-examination of the status of muscarinic receptor subtypes in the human brain. In AD, normal levels of m1 receptor [3H]-pirenzepine binding contrasted with diminished m1 immunoreactivity, further suggesting that there is an altered form of the m1 receptor in the disease. Reduced m2 immunoreactivity was consistent with decreased numbers of m2 binding sites. Increased levels of m4 receptors were observed in both binding and immunoreactivity measurements. These findings suggest one possible explanation for the relative ineffectiveness of cholinergic replacement therapies used to date and suggest potential new directions for development of effective therapeutic strategies for AD.",

    "title": "considered a suitable model of human motoneuron disease, including the sporadic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 2. Evidences exist demonstrating increased oxidative stress in the spinal cord of Wobbler mice, whereas antioxidant therapy delayed neurodegeneration and improved muscle trophism. 21-Aminosteroids are glucocorticoid-derived hydrophobic compounds with antioxidant potency 3 times higher than vitamin E and 100 times higher than methylprednisolone. They do not bind to intracellular receptors, and prevent lipid peroxidation by insertion into membrane lipid bilayers. 3. In common with the spinal cord of ALS patients, Wobbler mice present astrocytosis with hyperexpression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and increased expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and growth-associated protein (GAP-43) in motoneurons. Here, we review our studies on the effects of a 21-aminosteroid on GFAP, NOS, and GAP-43. 4. First, we showed that 21-aminosteroid treatment further increased GFAP-expressing astrocytes in gray matter of the Wobbler spinal cord. This effect may provide neuroprotection if one considers a trophic and beneficial function of astrocytes during the course of degeneration. Other neuroprotectans used in Wobbler mice (T-588) also increased pre-existing astrocytosis. 5. Second, histochemical determination of NADPH-diaphorase, a parameter indicative of neuronal NOS activity, showed that the 21-aminosteroid down-regulated the high activity of this enzyme in ventral horn motoneurons. Therefore, suppression of nitric oxide by decreasing NADPH-diaphorase (NOS) activity may provide neuroprotection considering that excess NO is highly toxic to motoneurons. 6. Finally, 21-aminosteroid treatment significantly attenuated the aberrant expression of both GAP-43 protein and mRNA in Wobbler motoneurons. Hyperexpression of GAP-43 possibly indicated abnormal synaptogenesis, denervation, and muscle atrophy, parameters which may return to normal following antioxidant steroid treatment. 7. Besides 21-aminosteroids, other steroids also behave as neuroprotectans. In this regard, degenerative diseases may constitute potential targets of these hormones, based on the fact that the spinal cord expresses in a regional and cell-specific fashion, receptors for androgens. progesterone, adrenal steroids, and estrogens.",

    "title": "Mood stabilizers regulate cytoprotective and mRNA-binding proteins in the brain: long-term effects on cell survival and transcript stability.",
    "abstract": "Manic depressive illness (MDI) is a common, severe, chronic and often life-threatening illness. Despite well-established genetic diatheses and extensive research, the biochemical abnormalities underlying the predisposition to, and the pathophysiology of, these disorders remain to be clearly established. Despite formidable obstacles in our attempts to understand the underlying neurobiology of this illness, there is currently considerable excitement about the progress that is being made using novel strategies to identify changes in gene expression that may have therapeutic relevance in the long-term treatment of MDI. In this paper, we describe our recent research endeavours utilizing newer technologies, including a concerted series of mRNA RT-PCR studies, which has led to the identification of novel, hitherto completely unexpected targets for the long-term actions of mood stabilizers - the major cytoprotective protein bcl-2, a human mRNA binding (and stabilizing) protein, AUH, and a Rho kinase. These results add to the growing body of data suggesting that mood stabilizers may bring about some of their long-term benefits by enhancing neuroplasticity and cellular resilience. These results are noteworthy since recent morphometric brain imaging and post-mortem studies have demonstrated that MDI is associated with the atrophy and/or loss of neurons and glia. The development of novel treatments which more directly target molecules involved in critical CNS cell survival and cell death pathways have the potential to enhance neuroplasticity and cellular resilience, and thereby modulate the long-term course and trajectory of these devastating illnesses.",

    "title": "Regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor expression by estrogens and progestins.",
    "abstract": "Estrogens increase the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA in the rodent uterus. This regulatory effect is rapid, beginning within 1 hr after hormone treatment, dose dependent, and blocked by the pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780. The induction of the transcript is blocked by inhibitors of RNA but not of protein synthesis, and we have recently identified estrogen response elements in the VEGF gene. Collectively, these findings indicate that estrogens regulate uterine VEGF expression at the transcriptional level via the classical nuclear estrogen receptor pathway. Estrogen induction of VEGF occurs in the stromal layer of the rodent uterus, and estradiol induces expression of VEGF transcript levels in cultured human uterine stromal cells. Progestins also induce VEGF expression in the rodent uterus, although the effect is less marked and slower in onset than estrogenic effects. The effect of progestins is blocked by the antiprogestin mifepristone (RU-486), suggesting that it is also mediated by a classical nuclear receptor pathway. In addition, progestins regulate expression of VEGF mRNA and protein in cultured human T47-D breast cancer cells. The development of uterine leiomyomas is associated with exposure to ovarian sex steroids, abnormal uterine bleeding is commonly seen in patients with leiomyomas, and fibroids require an increased vascular supply for their growth. These observations suggest that VEGF and other angiogenic factors may represent potential targets for the treatment and prevention of uterine fibroids.",

    "title": "A phase I study of sequential intravenous topotecan and etoposide in lung cancer patients.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan (T) and the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide (E) are active drugs in lung cancer. The complementary functions of their targets may suggest benefit from the combined use of these agents but drug scheduling has been shown to play a critical role in preclinical models. To establish the optimal schedule and assess the impact of sequential administration of the combination of T and E, we conducted a dose finding study of sequential intravenous T and E in a four-weekly-schedule in relapsed lung cancer patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The importance of drug sequence was assessed in consecutive patients throughout all dose levels; patients received in the first course either T followed by E (the TE group: T on days 1-3 and E on days 4-6) or E before T (the ET group: F on days 1-3 and Ton days 4-6). The sequence of Tand E was alternated in the successive courses. In this crossover design, each patient served as his own control for analysis of hematological toxicity in which TE sequence was compared to that of the ET sequence. Moreover, hematological toxicity after the first course was compared between the TE and the ET groups. The starting dose was T/E 0.75/75 mg/m2 at dose level 1and dose escalation was planned to T/E 1.00/75 mg/nm2 at dose level 2, T/E 1.00/100 mg/m2 at dose level 3, T/E 1.25/100 mg/m2 at dose level 4 and T/E 1.50/100 mg/m2 at dose level 5. Nineteen patients (small-cell lung cancer 7, non-small-cell lung cancer 11, mesothelioma 1 patient) were included.RESULTS: The principal toxicity was myelosuppression, primarily neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. At dose level 3 several grade 4 toxicities were observed. DLT (febrile neutropenia) occurred in two patients, one in the TE and one in the ET group and precluded further dose escalation. There was no significant difference in WBC and platelet nadirs during the first course between the TE and the ET group. The influence of the sequence of administration of topotecan and etoposide was calculated by comparing the nadir values of cycles I and II for each patient. For none of the dose levels, a significant sequence-dependent effect could be detected. The MTD was reached at the doses of 100 mg/m2 topotecan and 75 mg/m2 etoposide.

    "title": "Proteomic approaches within the NCI early detection research network for the discovery and identification of cancer biomarkers.",
    "abstract": "In the postgenome era, proteomics provides a powerful approach for the analysis of normal and transformed cell functions, for the identification of disease-specific targets, and for uncovering novel endpoints for the evaluation of chemoprevention agents and drug toxicity. Unfortunately, the genomic information that has greatly expounded the genetic basis of cancer does not allow an accurate prediction of what is actually occurring at the protein level within a given cell type at any given time. The gene expression program of a given cell is affected by numerous factors in the in vivo environment resulting from tissue complexity and organ system orchestration, with cells acting in concert with each other and responding to changes in their microenvironment. Repositories of genomic information can be considered master \"inventory lists\" of genes and their maps, which need to be supplemented with protein-derived information. The National Cancer Institute's Early Detection Research Network is employing proteomics, or \"protein walking\", in the discovery and evaluation of biomarkers for cancer detection and for the identification of high-risk subjects. Armed with microdissection techniques, including the use of Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) to procure pure populations of cells directly from human tissue, the Network is facilitating the development of technologies that can overcome the problem of tissue heterogeneity and address the need to identify markers in easily accessible biological fluids. Proteomic approaches complement plasma-based assays of circulating DNA for cancer detection and risk assessment. LCM, coupled with downstream proteomics applications, such as two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and SELDI (surface enhanced laser desorption ionization) separation followed by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, may greatly facilitate the characterization and identification of protein expression changes that track normal and disease phenotypes. We highlight recent work from Network investigators to demonstrate the potential of proteomics to identify proteins present in cancer tissues and body fluids that are relevant for cancer screening.",

The majority of the studies covered epidemiology of tuberculosis (n=76) in Pakistan, whereas the rest of the papers addressed issues like pediatric tuberculosis (n=53), tuberculosis among Pakistani immigrants (n=35), tuberculosis-HIV synergism (n=24), care seeking (n=19), adherence with tuberculosis treatment (n=14), tuberculosis among women (n=12), tuberculosis prevention (n=12), directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) strategy modification (n=5), tuberculosis drug resistance (n=7), operational research (n=5), tuberculosis case management (n=4), and research on Mycobacterium (n=2). Qualitative analysis revealed that research and spending on tuberculosis policy and nationwide tuberculosis interventions are not sufficient. Available research knowledge has not yet been translated into the tuberculosis policy and interventions. Furthermore, the lack of insight of the health system on community dynamics and tuberculosis intervention has led to failure in achieving the desired targets in tuberculosis control.CONCLUSION: Health system in Pakistan needs to improve tuberculosis control interventions by conducting extensive research on the various potential weaknesses in the field. For an effective tuberculosis eradication program in a highly endemic country such as Pakistan, health system research should be an integral part of the National Tuberculosis Control Program.",

    "title": "The lipids of Pneumocystis carinii.",
    "abstract": "Information about a number of Pneumocystis carinii lipids obtained by the analyses of organisms isolated and purified from infected lungs of corticosteroid-immunosuppressed rats has been reported in recent years. Of the common opportunistic protists associated with AIDS (Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, and the microsporidia), more is currently known about the lipids of P. carinii than the others. Lipids that are synthesized by the organism but not by humans are attractive targets for drug development. Thus, the elucidation of delta 7C-24-alykylated sterol and cis-9,10-epoxystearic acid biosyntheses in P. carinii is currently being examined in detail, since these have been identified as P. carinii-specific lipids. The development of low-toxicity drugs that prevent sterol C-24 alkylation and the specific inhibition of the lipoxygenase that forms cis-9,10-epoxystearic acid might prove fruitful. Although humans can synthesize coenzyme Q10, the anti-P. carinii activity and low toxicity of ubiquinone analogs such as atovaquone suggest that the electron transport chain in the pathogen may differ importantly from that in the host. Although resistance to atovaquone has been observed, development of other naphthoquinone drugs would provide a broader armamentarium of drugs to treat patients with P. carinii pneumonia. Studies of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and of infected lungs have demonstrated that the infection causes a number of chemical abnormalities. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained after the removal of lung cellular material and the organisms has been shown to contain larger amounts of surfactant proteins and smaller amounts of phospholipids than do comparable samples from P. carinii-free lungs. Increased phospholipase activity, inhibition of surfactant secretion by type II cells, and uptake and catabolism of lipids by the pathogen may explain this phenomenon related to P. carinii pneumonia. Although not yet thoroughly examined, initial studies on the uptake and metabolism of lipids by P. carinii suggest that the organism relies heavily on exogenous lipid nutrients.",

    "title": "[Cell cycle regulation after exposure to ionizing radiation].",
    "abstract": "When cells are exposed to ionizing radiation, they initiate a complex response that includes the arrest of cell cycle progression in G1 and G2, apoptosis and DNA repair. DNA is an important subcellular target of ionizing radiation, but oxydative damage to plasma membrane lipids initiates signal transduction pathways that activate apoptosis and that may play a role in cell cycle regulation. How is DNA damage converted into intracellular signals for cell cycle arrest? The ataxia telangectasia mutant (ATM) protein and/or the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), that are both activated by DNA damage, may initiate cell cycle arrest by activating the p53 tumor suppressor protein. The p53 protein acts as a transcription factor and regulates expression of several components implicated in pathways that regulate cell cycle progression. The best known, p21WAF1/CIP1 protein, is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), a family of protein kinases known as key regulators of cell cycle progression. p21WAF1/CIP1 was shown to be able to inhibit several CDK, but is most effective toward G1/S cyclins. Other CDK inhibitors, p27KIP1 and p15INK4b are activated by irradiation and contribute to the G1 arrest. Moreover, radiation-induced G2 arrest was shown to require inhibitory phosphorylation of the kinase cdc2 via an ATM-dependent pathway. Mutations in cell cycle regulatory genes are common in human cancer and cell cycle regulatory deficiency can lead to increase resistance to ionizing radiation in cancer cells. The major function of p53-dependent G1 arrest may be elimination of cells containing DNA damage whereas G2 arrest following radiation has been shown to be important in protecting cells from death. Cell cycle checkpoints offer a new set of potential targets for chemotherapeutic compounds, especially the G2 checkpoint. Thus, abrogation of the G2 checkpoint with methylxanthines such as caffeine or protein kinase inhibitors such as staurosporine and UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporine) was found to sensitize cells to ionizing radiation. These data did not lead to clinical applications, but confirm targeting of the G2 checkpoint may be an important strategy for cancer therapy.",

    "title": "Novel mechanisms of estrogen action in the brain: new players in an old story.",
    "abstract": "Estrogen elicits a selective enhancement of the growth and differentiation of axons and dendrites (neurites) in the developing brain. Widespread colocalization of estrogen and neurotrophin receptors (trk) within estrogen and neurotrophin targets, including neurons of the cerebral cortex, sensory ganglia, and PC12 cells, has been shown to result in differential and reciprocal transcriptional regulation of these receptors by their ligands. In addition, estrogen and neurotrophin receptor coexpression leads to convergence or cross-coupling of their signaling pathways, particularly at the level of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade. 17beta-Estradiol elicits rapid (within 5-15 min) and sustained (at least 2 h) tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the MAP kinases, extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1, and ERK2, which is successfully inhibited by the MAP kinase/ERK kinase 1 inhibitor PD98059, but not by the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI 182,780 and also does not appear to result from estradiol-induced activation of trk. Furthermore, the ability of estradiol to phosphorylate ERK persists even in ER-alpha knockout mice, implicating other estrogen receptors such as ER-beta in these actions of estradiol. The existence of an estrogen receptor-containing, multimeric complex consisting of hsp90, src, and B-Raf also suggests a direct link between the estrogen receptor and the MAP kinase signaling cascade. Collectively, these novel findings, coupled with our growing understanding of additional signaling substrates utilized by estrogen, provide alternative mechanisms for estrogen action in the developing brain which could explain not only some of the very rapid effects of estrogen, but also the ability of estrogen and neurotrophins to regulate the same broad array of cytoskeletal and growth-associated genes involved in neurite growth and differentiation. This review expands the usually restrictive view of estrogen action in the brain beyond the confines of sexual differentiation and reproductive neuroendocrine function. It considers the much broader question of estrogen as a neural growth factor with important influences on the development, survival, plasticity, regeneration, and aging of the mammalian brain and supports the view that the estrogen receptor is not only a ligand-induced transcriptional enhancer but also a mediator of rapid, nongenomic events.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.",

    "abstract": "Rituximab, a chimeric antibody that targets CD20(+) B cells, produces a 48% response rate in patients with refractory low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In this phase II trial, patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma who had previously received no systemic therapy were treated with rituximab, 375 mg/m(2), administered by IV infusion for 4 consecutive weeks. Patients with objective response or stable disease received repeat 4-week courses of rituximab at 6-month intervals. At the time of initial reevaluation at 6 weeks, 21 of 39 patients (54%) had objective response to treatment, and an additional 14 patients (36%) had stable disease or minor response. Response rates were similar in patients with follicular and small lymphocytic (CLL-type) lymphoma (52% versus 57%, respectively). At present, follow-up is short and only 13 patients have undergone a second course of rituximab treatment. However, 4 additional responses were documented either prior to the second course of rituximab (2 patients) or following the second course (2 patients) and 4 patients improved from partial to complete response. The current response rate is 64%, with 6 complete responses (15%). Treatment with rituximab was well tolerated, with only 1 patient experiencing grade 3/4 infusion-related toxicity. Rituximab is well tolerated and highly active in patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma previously untreated with systemic therapy. Although further follow-up is required, the demonstration of minimal toxicity and considerable activity of this new biologic agent represents an important beginning of more specific, less toxic treatment for this important group of cancer patients.",

    "title": "Pathophysiology and recent advances in the management of renal osteodystrophy.",
    "abstract": "Bone disease is observed in 75-100% of patients with chronic renal failure as the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls below 60 ml/minute. Hyperparathyroid (high turnover) bone disease is found most frequently followed by mixed osteodystrophy, low-turnover bone disease, and osteomalacia. With advancing renal impairment, \"skeletal resistance\" to parathyroid hormone (PTH) occurs. To maintain bone turnover, intact PTH (iPTH) targets from two to four times the upper normal range have been suggested, but whole PTH(1-84) assays indicate that amino-terminally truncated fragments, which accumulate in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), account for up to one-half of the measured iPTH. PTH levels and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) provide some information on bone involvement but bone biopsy and histomorphometry remains the gold standard. Calcitriol and calcium salts can be used to suppress PTH and improve osteomalacia but there is growing concern that these agents predispose to the development of vascular calcification, cardiovascular morbidity, low-turnover bone disease and fracture. Newer therapeutic options include less calcemic vitamin D analogues, calcimimetics and bisphosphonates for hyperparathyroidism, and sevelamer for phosphate control. Calcitriol and hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) have been shown to maintain bone mineral density (BMD) in certain patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). After renal transplantation, renal osteodystrophy generally improves but BMD often worsens. Bisphosphonate therapy may be appropriate for some patients at risk of fracture. When renal bone disease is assessed using a combination of biochemical markers, histology and bone densitometry, early intervention and the careful use of an increasing number of effective therapies can reduce the morbidity associated with this common problem.",

    "abstract": "Comment in    Thorax. 2001 May;56(5):335-6. doi: 10.1136/thorax.56.5.335.BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) and prostanoids are mediators of vascular and bronchial tone that are postulated to be involved in asthma. Increased levels of both are found in asthmatic subjects and are synthesised by enzymes that have cytokine inducible forms: inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), respectively. We hypothesised that the in vivo expression of iNOS and COX-2 in the airways would be increased in asthma, and that these cytokine inducible enzymes may represent targets for regulation by corticosteroid treatment.METHODS: Bronchial biopsy specimens were obtained from three groups of subjects: atopic asthmatics treated with beta(2) agonists alone (n=7), atopic asthmatics additionally receiving regular treatment with corticosteroids (n=8), and non-asthmatic control subjects (n=10). Expression of iNOS and COX-2 mRNA and immunoreactive protein was studied using in situ hybridisation and quantitative immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: Immunoreactivity and the hybridisation signal for iNOS and COX-2 were mainly localised in the airway epithelium. The proportion of epithelium immunostained was significantly greater in the non-steroid treated asthmatic subjects (iNOS 8.6 (1.8)%; COX-2 26.3 (4.6)%) than either the steroid treated asthmatics (iNOS 3.4 (1.0)%, p=0.009; COX-2 13.0 (0.6)%, p=0.0015) or the non-asthmatic controls (iNOS 4.2 (0.9)%, p=0.018; COX-2 11.6 (0.6)%, p=0.0003). Similarly, the hybridisation signal was stronger in the non-steroid treated group of asthmatic subjects than in the other two groups.CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the potential role of the airway epithelium both as a contributor to the inflammatory process in asthma and as a target for inhaled corticosteroid treatment in this disease.",

The remarkable insulinotropic properties of these toxins have attracted considerable attention by virtue of their use as selective molecular probes for analyses of beta-cell stimulus-secretion coupling. Targets of the toxins include heptahelical cell surface receptors, GTP-binding proteins, ion channels, Ca(2+) stores, and the exocytotic secretory apparatus. Here we review the value of insulinotropic toxins from the perspective of their established use in the study of signal transduction pathways activated by the blood glucose-lowering hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Our analysis of one insulinotropic toxin (alpha-latrotoxin) leads us to conclude that there exists a process of molecular mimicry whereby the 'lock and key'analogy inherent to hormone-receptor interactions is reproduced by a toxin related in structure to GLP-1.",

    "abstract": "Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are an inherent system of alloantigens, which are the products of genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). These genes span a region of approximately 4 centimorgans on the short arm of human chromosome 6 at band p 21.3 and encode the HLA class I and class II antigens, which play a central role in cell-to-cell interaction in the immune system. These antigens interact with the antigen-specific cell surface receptors of T lymphocytes (TCR) thus causing activation of the lymphocytes and the resulting immune response. Class I antigens restrict cytotoxic T-cell (CD8+) function thus killing viral infected targets, while class II antigens are involved in presentation of exogenous antigens to T-helper cells (CD4+) by antigen presenting cells (APC). The APC processes the antigens, and the immunogenic peptide is then presented at the cell surface along with the MHC molecule for recognition by the TCR. Since the MHC molecules play a central role in regulating the immune response, they may have an important role in controlling resistance and susceptibility to diseases. In this review we have highlighted studies conducted to look for an association between HLA and infectious diseases; such studies have had a variable degree of success because the pathogenesis of different diseases varies widely, and most diseases have a polygenic etiology.",

    "abstract": "Besides cytotoxicity, taxanes induce other biological effects, especially in the immune system. Taxanes have demonstrated immunostimulatory effects against neoplasms, supporting the idea that these agents suppress cancer through several mechanisms and not solely through inhibiting cell division. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) and investigate their ability in alterating important immunological parameters in breast cancer patients. Thirty women with advanced breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy were randomly assigned into two groups treated with either single agent Paclitaxel or Docetaxel. Sera from patients before the first and after the last treatment cycle and from normal donors were assayed by ELISA for IL-2, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and PGE2 levels. In these same blood samples, NK and LAK cell activity was tested in the total PBMC population against NK-sensitive K562 tumour targets, respectively, and autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction was tested by (3)H-thymidine proliferation assays. All patients in both groups responded to therapy. Significant differences were observed in the following immune parameters between the control group of healthy blood donors and the pretreatment values of both taxane groups; IL-2, GM-CSF, IFN-gamma levels and NK and LAK cell cytotoxicity were depressed, whereas TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels were raised in breast cancer patients before treatment compared to controls. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups regarding any of the parameters studied. Both drugs led to increases in MLR values, NK and LAK cell cytotoxicity, and IL-6, GM-CSF, IFN-gamma levels, and decreases for IL-1, TNF, and PGE2 levels. The percentage of these differences was greater for docetaxel in comparison to paclitaxel (P<0.0001). More specifically, docetaxel demonstrated a more pronounced effect on enhancing MLR, NK, LAK activity and IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-6, and GM-CSF levels, as well as caused more potent reduction in IL-1 and TNF-alpha levels when compared to paclitaxel. The present study indicates that patients responded to treatment of advanced breast cancer with single-agent paclitaxel or docetaxel leads to an increase in serum IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-6, GM-CSF cytokine levels and enhancement of PBMC NK and LAK cell activity, while they both lead to a decrease of acute phase serum cytokine levels of IL-1 and TNF-alpha. Moreover, the effects of docetaxel are in all the above parameters more pronounced than those of paclitaxel.Copyright 2002 Cancer Research UK",

In this review we emphasize i) the role of LXR in controlling many aspects of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, ii) the expanded role of FXR in regulating genes that control not only bile acid metabolism but also lipoprotein metabolism, and iii) the regulation of bile acid transport/metabolism in response to bile acid-activated PXR.",

    "title": "Sphingosine 1-phosphate signalling in mammalian cells.",
    "abstract": "Sphingosine 1-phosphate is formed in cells in response to diverse stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, G-protein-coupled receptor agonists, antigen, etc. Its production is catalysed by sphingosine kinase, while degradation is either via cleavage to produce palmitaldehyde and phosphoethanolamine or by dephosphorylation. In this review we discuss the most recent advances in our understanding of the role of the enzymes involved in metabolism of this lysolipid. Sphingosine 1-phosphate can also bind to members of the endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) G-protein-coupled receptor family [namely EDG1, EDG3, EDG5 (also known as H218 or AGR16), EDG6 and EDG8] to elicit biological responses. These receptors are coupled differentially via G(i), G(q), G(12/13) and Rho to multiple effector systems, including adenylate cyclase, phospholipases C and D, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and non-receptor tyrosine kinases. These signalling pathways are linked to transcription factor activation, cytoskeletal proteins, adhesion molecule expression, caspase activities, etc. Therefore sphingosine 1-phosphate can affect diverse biological responses, including mitogenesis, differentiation, migration and apoptosis, via receptor-dependent mechanisms. Additionally, sphingosine 1-phosphate has been proposed to play an intracellular role, for example in Ca(2+) mobilization, activation of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, inhibition of caspases, etc. We review the evidence for both intracellular and extracellular actions, and extensively discuss future approaches that will ultimately resolve the question of dual action. Certainly, sphingosine 1-phosphate will prove to be unique if it elicits both extra- and intra-cellular actions. Finally, we review the evidence that implicates sphingosine 1-phosphate in pathophysiological disease states, such as cancer, angiogenesis and inflammation. Thus there is a need for the development of new therapeutic compounds, such as receptor antagonists. However, identification of the most suitable targets for drug intervention requires a full understanding of the signalling and action profile of this lysosphingolipid. This article describes where the research field is in relation to achieving this aim.",

    "title": "Structure and function of aquaporin water channels.",
    "abstract": "The aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of small membrane-spanning proteins (monomer size approximately 30 kDa) that are expressed at plasma membranes in many cells types involved in fluid transport. This review is focused on the molecular structure and function of mammalian aquaporins. Basic features of aquaporin structure have been defined using mutagenesis, epitope tagging, and spectroscopic and freeze-fracture electron microscopy methods. Aquaporins appear to assemble in membranes as homotetramers in which each monomer, consisting of six membrane-spanning alpha-helical domains with cytoplasmically oriented amino and carboxy termini, contains a distinct water pore. Medium-resolution structural analysis by electron cryocrystallography indicated that the six tilted helical segments form a barrel surrounding a central pore-like region that contains additional protein density. Several of the mammalian aquaporins (e.g., AQP1, AQP2, AQP4, and AQP5) appear to be highly selective for the passage of water, whereas others (recently termed aquaglyceroporins) also transport glycerol (e.g., AQP3 and AQP8) and even larger solutes (AQP9). Evidence for possible movement of ions and carbon dioxide through the aquaporins is reviewed here, as well as evidence for direct regulation of aquaporin function by posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation. Important unresolved issues include definition of the molecular pathway through which water and solutes move, the nature of monomer-monomer interactions, and the physiological significance of aquaporin-mediated solute movement. Recent results from knockout mice implicating multiple physiological roles of aquaporins suggest that the aquaporins may be suitable targets for drug discovery by structure-based and/or high-throughput screening strategies.",

    "title": "Oxaliplatin: a review of preclinical and clinical studies.",
    "abstract": "Of the new generation platinum compounds that have been evaluated, those with the 1,2-diaminocyclohexane carrier ligand-including oxaliplatin--have been focused upon in recent years. Molecular biology studies and the National Cancer Institute in vitro cytotoxic screening showed that diaminocyclohexane platinums such as oxaliplatin belong to a distinct cytotoxic family, differing from cisplatin and carboplatin, with specific intracellular target(s), mechanism(s) of action and/or mechanism(s) of resistance. In phase I trials, the dose-limiting toxicity of oxaliplatin was characterized by transient acute dysesthesias and cumulative distal neurotoxicity, which was reversible within a few months after treatment discontinuation. Moreover, oxaliplatin did not display any, auditory, renal and hematologic dose-limiting toxicity at the recommended dose of 130 mg/m2 q three weeks or 85 mg/m2 q two weeks given as a two-hour i.v. infusion. Clinical phase II experiences on the antitumoral activity of oxaliplatin have been conducted in hundreds of patients with advanced colorectal cancers (ACRC). Single agent activity reported as objective response rate in ACRC patients is 10% and 20% overall in ACRC patients with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) pretreated/refractory and previously untreated ACRC, respectively. Synergistic cytotoxic effects in preclinical studies with thymidylate synthase inhibitors, cisplatin/carboplatin and topoisomerase I inhibitors, and the absence of hematologic dose-limiting toxicity have made oxaliplatin an attractive compound for combinations. Phase II trials combining oxaliplatin with 5-FU and folinic acid ACRC patients previously treated/refractory to 5-FU showed overall response rates ranging from 21% to 58%, and survivals ranging from 12 to 17 months. In patients with previously untreated ACRC, combinations of oxaliplatin with 5-FU and folinic acid showed response rates ranging from 34% to 67% and median survivals ranging from 15 to 19 months. Two randomized trials totaling 620 previously untreated patients with ACRC, comparing 5-FU and folinic acid to the same regimen with oxaliplatin, have shown a 34% overall response rate in the oxaliplatin group versus 12% in the 5-FU/folinic acid group for the first trial; and 51.2% vs. 22.6% in the second one. These statistically significant differences were confirmed in time to progression advantage for the oxaliplatin arm (8.7 vs. 6.1 months, and 8.7 vs. 6.1 months, respectively). A small but consistent number of histological complete responses have been reported in patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with the combination of oxaliplatin with 5-FU/folinic acid, and secondary metastasectomy is increasingly done by oncologists familiar with the combination. Based on preclinical and clinical reports showing additive or synergistic effects between oxaliplatin and several anticancer drugs including cisplatin, irinotecan, topotecan, and paclitaxel, clinical trials of combinations with other compounds have been performed or are still ongoing in tumor types in which oxaliplatin alone showed antitumoral activity such as ovarian, non-small-cell lung, breast cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Its single agent and combination therapy data in ovarian cancer confirm its non-cross resistance with cisplatin/carboplatin. While the role of oxaliplatin in medical oncology is yet to be fully defined, it appears to be an important new anticancer agent.",

    "title": "National tuberculosis programme review: experience over the period 1990-95.",
    "abstract": "Since 1990 the WHO Global Tuberculosis Programme (GTB) has promoted the revision of national tuberculosis programmes to strengthen the focus on directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) and close monitoring of treatment outcomes. GTB has encouraged in-depth evaluation of activities through a comprehensive programme review. Over the period 1990-95, WHO supported 12 such programme reviews. The criteria for selection were as follows: large population (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Thailand); good prospects of developing a model programme for a region (Nepal, Zimbabwe); or at advanced stage of implementation of a model programme for a region (Guinea, Peru). The estimated combined incidence of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis was 82 per 100,000 population, about 43% of the global incidence. The prevalence of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was variable, being very high in Ethiopia and Zimbabwe, but negligible in Bangladesh, China, Nepal and Peru. The programme reviews were conducted by teams of 15-35 experts representing a wide range of national and external institutions. After a 2-3-month preparatory period, the conduct of the review usually lasted 2-3 weeks, including a first phase of meetings with authorities and review of documents, a second phase for field visits, and a third phase of discussion of findings and recommendations. The main lessons learned from the programme reviews were as follows: programme review is a useful tool to secure government commitment, reorient the tuberculosis control policies and replan the activities on solid grounds; the involvement of public health and academic institutions, cooperating agencies, and nongovernmental organizations secured a broad support to the new policies; programme success is linked to a centralized direction which supports a decentralized implementation through the primary health care services; monitoring and evaluation of case management functions well if it is based on the right classification of cases and quarterly reports on cohorts of patients; a comprehensive programme review should include teaching about tuberculosis in medical, nursing, and laboratory workers' schools; good quality diagnosis and treatment are the essential requirements for expanding a programme beyond the pilot testing; and control targets cannot be achieved if private and social security patients are left outside the programme scope. The methodology of comprehensive programme review should be recommended to all countries which require programme reorientation; it is also appropriate for carrying out evaluations at 4-5-year intervals in countries that are implementing the correct tuberculosis control policies.PIP: Over the period 1990-95, the World Health Organization (WHO) conducted 12 reviews of national tuberculosis programs, with emphasis on passive case finding; directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS); drug supply; and treatment outcome monitoring. Criteria for program selection were: large population (Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Thailand); good potential for developing a model regional program (Nepal, Zimbabwe); or advanced stage of implementation of a model program (Guinea, Peru). The 2-3-week review process included interviews with authorities, document reviews, field visits, and discussions of findings. The estimated combined incidence of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis was 82/100,000 population--about 43% of the global incidence. These reviews suggested the following observations: 1) program review is a useful tool to secure government commitment, reorient tuberculosis control policies, and replan activities on a more solid basis; 2) the involvement of academic and public health institutions, cooperating agencies, and nongovernmental organizations secures broad support for new policies; 3) program success is linked to a centralized direction that supports a decentralized implementation through the primary health care system; 4) monitoring and evaluation of case management function well if based on the correct classification of cases and quarterly reports on cohorts of patients; 5) a comprehensive program review should include teaching about tuberculosis in medical, nursing, and laboratory workers' schools; 6) good quality diagnosis and treatment are essential requirements for expanding a program beyond pilot testing; and 7) tuberculosis control targets cannot be achieved if private and social security patients are excluded from program coverage.",

    "abstract": "Erratum in    Exp Hematol. 2000 Mar;28(3):347.OBJECTIVE: Autologous interleukin 2 (IL-2)-activated natural killer (NK) cells kill a broad spectrum of tumor targets, including breast cancer. We hypothesized that mobilization with IL-2 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for collection of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) may enhance the anti-tumor activity of the graft in autograft recipients. We determined the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of subcutaneous IL-2 given with G-CSF for PBPC mobilization, the ability of IL-2 + G-CSF mobilized stem cells to reconstitute hematopoiesis, and the in vitro immunologic function of the graft in patients with advanced breast cancer. MATERIALS AID METHODS: Forty-three women with stage IIIA/B or metastatic breast cancer underwent mobilization of PBPC with IL-2 administered subcutaneously for 14 days along with G-CSF for the latter 7 days. IL-2 was given in a dose-escalated manner, with the maximum tolerated dose determined to be 1.75 x 10(6) IU/m(2)/day. Fifteen women with stage IIIA/B or metastatic breast cancer underwent G-CSF mobilization alone and served as a control group.RESULTS: [corrected] Fifty-two percent of the patients mobilized with 1L-2 at the maximum tolerated dose reached the target number of CD34(+) cells for transplantation with three aphereses compared to 93% of control patients who were mobilized with G-CSF alone. [corrected] There was no significant impact on time to engraftment of neutrophils or platelets using either mobilization regimen. The addition of subcutaneous IL-2 to mobilization increased the cytotoxicity of IL-2-activated mononuclear cells from the PBPC product against the breast cancer cell target, MCF-7, and increased the percentage of NK cells and activated T cells in the PBPC product. The enhanced NK cell number was sustained in the early posttransplant period.CONCLUSIONS: [corrected] IL-2 + G-CSF mobilization is safe, may lead to a more immunologically functional graft without impairing hematologic recovery, and thus merits further exploration to evaluate the clinical anti-tumor efficacy of these immunocompetent grafts. [corrected] Limitations of this combined approach to stem cell mobilization include a decrease in the number of CD34(+) cells mobilized with the combined cytokines and the short duration of the increased number of anti-tumor effector cells after transplant.",

    "title": "Effect of hemoglobin levels in hemodialysis patients with asymptomatic cardiomyopathy.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hemoglobin levels below 10 g/dL lead to left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, LV dilation, a lower quality of life, higher cardiac morbidity, and a higher mortality rate in end-stage renal disease. The benefits and risks of normalizing hemoglobin levels in hemodialysis patients without symptomatic cardiac disease are unknown.METHODS: One hundred forty-six hemodialysis patients with either concentric LV hypertrophy or LV dilation were randomly assigned to receive doses of epoetin alpha designed to achieve hemoglobin levels of 10 or 13.5 g/dL. The study duration was 48 weeks. The primary outcomes were the change in LV mass index in those with concentric LV hypertrophy and the change in cavity volume index in those with LV dilation.RESULTS: In patients with concentric LV hypertrophy, the changes in LV mass index were similar in the normal and low target hemoglobin groups. The changes in cavity volume index were similar in both targets in the LV dilation group. Treatment-received analysis of the concentric LV hypertrophy group showed no correlation between the change in mass index and a correlation between the change in LV volume index and mean hemoglobin level achieved (8 mL/m2 per 1 g/dL hemoglobin decrement, P = 0.009). Mean hemoglobin levels and the changes in LV mass and cavity volume index were not correlated in patients with LV dilation. Normalization of hemoglobin led to improvements in fatigue (P = 0.009), depression (P = 0.02), and relationships (P = 0.004).CONCLUSIONS: Normalization of hemoglobin does not lead to regression of established concentric LV hypertrophy or LV dilation. It may, however, prevent the development of LV dilation, and it leads to improved quality of life.",

    "title": "How are the regulators regulated? The search for mechanisms that impose specificity on induction of cell death and NF-kappaB activation by members of the TNF/NGF receptor family.",
    "abstract": "Signals emanating from receptors of the tumor necrosis factor/nerve growth factor (TNF/NGF) family control practically all aspects of immune defense and, as such, constitute potential targets for therapeutic intervention through rational drug design. Indeed, arrest of these signals by blocking ligand-receptor interactions enables effective suppression of a variety of activities that are implicated in various pathologies, such as T and B lymphocyte activation and growth, inflammation, fibroblast proliferation, and cell death. To be therapeutically useful, however, inhibition of signaling should be restricted by determinants of specificity, at least to the same degree observed when blocking activation of individual receptors. In spite of their broad range of functions, receptors of the TNF/NGF family are known to activate just a few signaling pathways. Of these, the most extensively studied are the activation of the caspase protease cascade, which leads to cell death, and the activation of NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB) transcription factors through protein phosphorylation cascades. Until recently, most studies of the two pathways have solely focused on the core signaling complexes that are shared by the different receptors: death-inducing complexes containing the cysteine proteases caspase-8 and caspase-10, bound to the adapter protein MORT1/FADD (mediator of receptor-induced toxicity/Fas-associated DD protein), and the NF-kappaB-activating complex, composed of the protein kinases IKK1 (IkappaB kinase 1) and IKK2 (IkappaB kinase 2) and the regulatory subunit NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator; the 'IKK signalosome'). Knowledge has begun to emerge of additional molecules and mechanisms that affect these basic signaling complexes and impose specificity on their function.",

    "abstract": "Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with extracellular deposition of mutant transthyretin (TTR) amyloid fibrils, particularly in the peripheral nervous system. We have hypothesized that binding of TTR fibrils to the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) on critical cellular targets is associated with a destructive stress response underlying peripheral nerve dysfunction. Analysis of nerve biopsy samples from patients with FAP (n = 16) at different stages of disease (0-3), compared with age-matched controls (n = 4), by semiquantitative immunohistology and in situ hybridization showed increased levels of RAGE, beginning at the earliest stages of the disease (FAP 0; p < 0.02) and especially localized in axons. Upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta) (approximately threefold; p < 0.02) and the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) ( approximately 2.5-fold; p < 0.04) was also observed in a distribution overlapping RAGE expression. Tyrosine nitration and increased activated caspase-3 in axons from FAP patients (p < 0.03) were apparent. Although these data suggest the presence of ongoing neuronal stress, there was no upregulation of neurotrophins (nerve growth factor and neurotrophin-3) in FAP nerves. Studies on cultured neuronal-like, Schwann, and endothelial cells incubated with TTR fibrils displayed RAGE-dependent expression of cytokines and iNOS at early times (6 and 12 hr, respectively), followed by later (24 hr) activation of caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation. We propose that the interaction of TTR fibrils with RAGE may contribute to cellular stress and toxicity in FAP. Furthermore, there is an apparent lack of responsiveness of Schwann cells in FAP nerve to provide neurotrophic factors.",

    "title": "Extracellular calcium sensing and extracellular calcium signaling.",
    "abstract": "The cloning of a G protein-coupled extracellular Ca(2+) (Ca(o)(2+))-sensing receptor (CaR) has elucidated the molecular basis for many of the previously recognized effects of Ca(o)(2+) on tissues that maintain systemic Ca(o)(2+) homeostasis, especially parathyroid chief cells and several cells in the kidney. The availability of the cloned CaR enabled the development of DNA and antibody probes for identifying the CaR's mRNA and protein, respectively, within these and other tissues. It also permitted the identification of human diseases resulting from inactivating or activating mutations of the CaR gene and the subsequent generation of mice with targeted disruption of the CaR gene. The characteristic alterations in parathyroid and renal function in these patients and in the mice with \"knockout\" of the CaR gene have provided valuable information on the CaR's physiological roles in these tissues participating in mineral ion homeostasis. Nevertheless, relatively little is known about how the CaR regulates other tissues involved in systemic Ca(o)(2+) homeostasis, particularly bone and intestine. Moreover, there is evidence that additional Ca(o)(2+) sensors may exist in bone cells that mediate some or even all of the known effects of Ca(o)(2+) on these cells. Even more remains to be learned about the CaR's function in the rapidly growing list of cells that express it but are uninvolved in systemic Ca(o)(2+) metabolism. Available data suggest that the receptor serves numerous roles outside of systemic mineral ion homeostasis, ranging from the regulation of hormonal secretion and the activities of various ion channels to the longer term control of gene expression, programmed cell death (apoptosis), and cellular proliferation. In some cases, the CaR on these \"nonhomeostatic\" cells responds to local changes in Ca(o)(2+) taking place within compartments of the extracellular fluid (ECF) that communicate with the outside environment (e.g., the gastrointestinal tract). In others, localized changes in Ca(o)(2+) within the ECF can originate from several mechanisms, including fluxes of calcium ions into or out of cellular or extracellular stores or across epithelium that absorb or secrete Ca(2+). In any event, the CaR and other receptors/sensors for Ca(o)(2+) and probably for other extracellular ions represent versatile regulators of numerous cellular functions and may serve as important therapeutic targets.",

    "title": "Methodologic guidelines for the design of high-dose chemotherapy regimens.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The objective of this report is to review the research methods that have been used in the design, analysis, and reporting of Phase I dose-escalation studies of high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with bone marrow or stem cell support and to propose new guidelines for such studies that incorporate emerging principles of pharmacology, toxicity assessment, statistical design, and long-term follow-up.METHODS: We performed a search of original, English-language, peer-reviewed full-length reports of HDCT (with or without radiotherapy) and unmanipulated hematopoietic precursor support (autologous bone marrow or stem cells or allogeneic bone marrow) in which one or more drug doses were escalated to identify dose-limiting toxicities needed for the design of subsequent Phase II trials. We reviewed the design, execution, analysis, and reporting of these trials to develop a coherent set of guidelines for the initiation of new HDCT regimens. The primary elements included in our analysis were the technique of dose escalation, the choice and application of toxicity grading scale, and the pharmacologic correlates of dose escalation. We also evaluated the methods employed to define dose-limiting toxicities and to select the maximum tolerated dose and the dose recommended for further study. We then examined whether subsequent Phase II trials based on these definitions corroborated the findings from the prior Phase I studies and summarized the findings from pharmacologic analyses that were reported from a subset of these investigations.RESULTS: Thirty-five reports met the criteria for our literature review. Two standard methods of dose escalation (fixed increments or modified Fibonacci increments) were described in detail and were employed in the majority (30/35) of the studies. In 5 studies, the details of dose escalation were either not provided or not adequately referenced. There was marked heterogeneity among toxicity grading methods; scales used included the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (or similar scales such as the United States cooperative group or World Health Organization scales) as well as substantially modified versions of those instruments. Wide variations in the methods used to identify dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Statistical considerations, applied to the identification of the maximum tolerated or Phase II recommended dose, were similarly heterogeneous. Phase II trial designs varied from a simple expansion of the Phase I trial to separate, formally conducted studies. Nine Phase I trials featured pharmacologic analyses, and these ranged from simple pharmacokinetic evaluations to more complex analyses of the relationship between drug dose and the molecular targets of drug action.CONCLUSIONS: Phase I clinical trials in the HDCT setting have been designed, analyzed, and reported using heterogeneous methods that limited their application to Phase II and II investigations. Moreover, correlative pharmacologic analyses have not been routinely undertaken during this critical Phase I stage. We propose guidelines for the design of new Phase I studies of HDCT based on 4 essential elements: (1) rational preclinical and clinical pharmacologic foundation for the regimen and for the agent selected for dose escalation; (2) incorporation of analytical pharmacology in the design and analysis of the regimen under investigation; (3) clear, prospective definitions of the dose- or exposure-limiting toxicities that can be distinguished from modality-dependent toxicities; selection of an appropriate toxicity grading scale, including an assessment of cumulative, delayed, and long-term effects of HDCT, particularly when designing tandem or repetitive cycle regimens; and (4) statistical input into the design, execution, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of these studies.",

    "title": "Control of NF-kappa B transcriptional activation by signal induced proteolysis of I kappa B alpha.",
    "abstract": "In unstimulated cells the transcription factor NF-kappa B is held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state by I kappa B inhibitor proteins. Ultimately activation of NF-kappa B is achieved by ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of I kappa B alpha and we have therefore investigated factors which control this proteolysis. Signal-induced degradation of I kappa B alpha exposes the nuclear localization signal of NF-kappa B, thus allowing it to translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription from responsive genes. An autoregulatory loop is established when NF-kappa B induces expression of the I kappa B alpha gene and newly synthesized I kappa B alpha accumulates in the nucleus where it negatively regulates NF-kappa B-dependent transcription. As part of this post-induction repression, the nuclear export signal on I kappa B alpha mediates transport of NF-kappa B-I kappa B alpha complexes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. As nuclear export of I kappa B alpha is blocked by leptomycin B this drug was used to examine the effect of cellular location on susceptibility of I kappa B alpha to signal-induced degradation. In the presence of leptomycin B, I kappa B alpha is accumulated in the nucleus and in this compartment is resistant to signal-induced degradation. Thus signal-induced degradation of I kappa B alpha is mainly, if not exclusively a cytoplasmic process. An efficient nuclear export of I kappa B alpha is therefore essential for maintaining a low level of I kappa B alpha in the nucleus and allowing NF-kappa B to be transcriptionally active upon cell stimulation. We have detected a modified form of I kappa B alpha, conjugated to the small ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1, which is resistant to signal-induced degradation. SUMO-1 modified I kappa B alpha remains associated with NF-kappa B and thus overexpression of SUMO-1 inhibits the signal-induced activation of NF-kappa B-dependent transcription. Reconstitution of the conjugation reaction with highly purified proteins demonstrated that in the presence of a novel E1 SUMO-1 activating enzyme, Ubch9 directly conjugated SUMO-1 to I kappa B alpha on residues K21 and K22, which are also used for ubiquitin modification. Thus, while ubiquitination targets proteins for rapid degradation, SUMO-1 modification acts antagonistically to generate proteins resistant to degradation.",
